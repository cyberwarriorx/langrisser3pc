With the demonic cannon out of the picture, our main army shouldn't be necessary, but....<$FFFE>
A local lord, Lord Raymond, has gathered an army stronger than we suspected, and sorely pressed our troops there.<$FFFE>
Also, an enigmatic black knight has appeared in the small country of Barral, inflicting massive damage on his own.<$FFFE>
That's why I have requested additional troops in addition to permission to attack with the aerial fortress and the magically-animated giant soldier, the Galshook.<$FFFE>
The aerial fortress is still being excavated.<$FFFC>
However, I approve the use of the Galshook.<$FFFC>
I trust you will use it well.....<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
......Hmmph.<$FFFE>
If you'll excuse me, I'll return to my work.<$FFFE>
After seeing how ill the Kaiser is, I was forced to remember how we lost the last Kaiser.<$FFFC>
But somehow, it doesn't seem like quite the same illness.<$FFFE>
Yes, I was thinking the same thing.<$FFFC>
Those symptoms are the same shown by my father in his final years.<$FFFC>
But, I don't think it is an ordinary illness.<$FFFE>
But even the doctor said he'd never seen the like of that illness, so he didn't know how he could help.....<$FFFC>
I have to wonder whether it's not at illness at all, but rather poison.....<$FFFE>
Hmm!?<$FFFC>
But if that's the case, could it be that someone poisoned the last Kaiser, too!<$FFFC>
If the Kaiser should die, the one who has the most to gain....<$FFFE>
Kaiser Kleist IV's successor is that Imperial First Prince, Paul.....<$FFFE>
If that's so, could it be that this punk, Paul, has poisoned the Kaiser!?<$FFFE>
Varna, that's a dangerous thing to say.<$FFFC>
Nowhere have we seen evidence for this proposed poisoning.<$FFFE>
Even I don't think Father died from an ordinary illness.....<$FFFC>
But, we have no evidence.<$FFFE>
Your Excellency.....<$FFFE>
I bear my uncle no grudge.<$FFFC>
But, I will watch this damned Paul well!<$FFFE>
There's no way in hell I'm letting a rat like him sit on the throne!<$FFFE>
I and the others of the four generals shall do all in our power to assure Your Excellency is restored to the line of succession.<$FFFE>
Thank you.<$FFFC>
Your power shall be very helpful for this cause of mine.<$FFFE>
For now, though, we shall use the Galshook to bring the Empire victory!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFC>
It shall be as you command!<$FFFE>
