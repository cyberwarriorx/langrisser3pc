During the Sealing Ceremony<$FFFF>
Awaken, sacred powers of the divine one. Saintly Sword imbued with the noble spirit of a king,<$FFFC>
take away the power from the Sword of Darkness Alhazard and put it into everlasting slumber.<<$FFFE>
The malicious aura grows weaker...<$FFFE>
*Huff*...<$FFFE>
Was it a success?<$FFFE>
Yes, it has been done.<$FFFE>
Our next steps should be to separate Alhazard and the Rods that holds the seal and keep them far away from each other.<$FFFE>
Also if Sophia has no descendants humankind will not be able to undo the seal.<$FFFE>
...We must prevent a tragedy like Altemüller's from happening ever again.<$FFFE>
So this would be the end of this story.<$FFFE>
I gave in to anger and became susceptible to Alhazard's manipulation...<$FFFE>
For that, I'm ashamed of myself...<$FFFE>
You mustn't be.<$FFFC>
It proves only the strength of your love towards Varna...<$FFFE>
...That couldn't be...<$FFFE>
In any case, what matters is that Alhazard is beyond the human grasp for now.<$FFFE>
By the way, what will happen to Langrisser now?<$FFFE>
Alhazard is no threat right now but couldn't Langrisser fall into the wrong hands as well?<$FFFE>
That's why the Langrisser was sealed too and will be kept save by the Elthlead royal family.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFC>
If that is so, I will assist the ELthlead royal family in the safekeeping Langrisser from here on out.<$FFFE>
So you won't return to the heavens?<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFC>
Alhazard is too dangerous to be left unwatched until a permanent solution is found.<$FFFE>
Also maybe someday someone could try to get a hold of Langrisser.<$FFFE>
Until those problems are solved, I will remain in the human world.<$FFFE>
But that may take decades or even hundreds of years.<$FFFE>
Ahaha.<$FFFC>
You see, I'm no ordinary human.<$FFFE>
I command a magic that allows me to reincarnate endlessly while keeping my memories.<$FFFE>
Oh my...<$FFFC>
To think that such a magnificent magic did exist...<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
What's the matter, Kirikaze?<$FFFE>
Böser was defeated and Alhazard has been sealed.<$FFFC>
Therefore my task is completed.<$FFFE>
Kirikaze.<$FFFC>
Do you really have to leave so urgently?<$FFFE>
Couldn't you just stay....<$FFFE>
No.<$FFFC>
There is still something I can return to.<$FFFC>
My new task will be to take care of the graves of my family and my master.<$FFFE>
Right now the world has no need for a man of my vocation.<$FFFC>
Therefore...<$FFFE>
Hm?<$FFFE>
I would like you to have my most treasured sword.<$FFFE>
You have grown into a fine man and led us to this victory.<$FFFC>
Take it as a token of my gratitude.<$FFFE>
But, Kirikaze...<$FFFE>
Please accept it.<$FFFC>
There is still much unrest left as a result of the terrible wars that just came to an end.<$FFFE>
Use this sword in my stead to protect the peace we all have fought so hard for.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
Won't you accept it?<$FFFE>
In the lands of the east ones sword is equal to ones life.<$FFFC>
Do you now understand what entrusting his sword to you means?<$FFFE>
.<$fe><$3c>.<$fe><$3c>.<$fe><$3c>.<$fe><$3c>Alright.<$FFFC>
I gratefully accept your gift.<$FFFE>
 <$FFFC>
Kirikaze's favorite sword,<$FFFC>
"Tiger Strike" was obtained!<$FFFE>
...Well, I will take my leave then.<$FFFE>
Farewell, Kirikaze.<$FFFE>
If everything is settled we should depart soon too.<$FFFE>
..I will remain in the Empire.<$FFFC>
The people of this land had to endure great suffering.<$FFFE>
From now it will be my task to rebuild this nation from scratch.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
Don't hesitate to ask for help if the need should arise.<$FFFC>
We will give you a hand any time.<$FFFE>
You can count on the help of the people of Elthlead too.<$FFFE>
Thank you.<$FFFC>
....<$FFFC>
...Till then.<$FFFE>
W..Well...<$FFFE>
What's the matter, Flaire?<$FFFE>
What are you going to do from here on..?<$FFFE>
Maybe..you could help me to rebuild Barral..<$FFFE>
What!<$FFFC>
You are going to go to Barral?<$FFFE>
...Now that the Kingdom of Elthlead is restored I intend to go on a journey.<$FFFE>
After all we couldn't save Altemüller.<$FFFC>
If only I had been a little more powerful he may could have been saved.<$FFFE>
That's why I want to travel to become even stronger.<$FFFE>
No matter how good my swordplay is, my mind is still inexperienced...<$FFFE>
So..that's how it is.<$FFFC>
I understand.<$FFFC>
In that case I'll be waiting for you.<$FFFE>
Forgive me, Flaire.<$FFFC>
One day I'll return to you, I promise!<$FFFE>
Yes, I'll be there.<$FFFC>
Now matter how long it takes, I'll be waiting.<$FFFE>
...In the meantime I will restore Barral.<$FFFC>
And once you return you'll be amazed by it's magnificence!<$FFFE>
I will return to Barral along with Dios.<$FFFE>
Now that the kings madness is over there is much to be done.<$FFFE>
Also it was due to the princess that I was able to escape,<$FFFC>
because she knew what I was doing was for the better of Barral.<$FFFE>
Now there it is my turn to stop running and rebuild Barral for their sake.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
If you need any kind of assistance let me know.<$FFFE>
For now I'm going back to Barral.<$FFFC>
There still is much confusion about the death of the royal family.<$FFFE>
At least until the next ruler is decided I will try to keep order.<$FFFE>
That's a good idea.<$FFFC>
Right now the world needs some peace.<$FFFC>
Secured by able man and women.<$FFFE>
Let's all do our best to create a better world.<$FFFC>
Alright!<$FFFE>
Now, there is still much disorder throughout the Empire as well that needs to be settled.<$FFFC>
Let us be on our way.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Yes...<$FFFE>
Don't hesitate to ask for help if the need should arise.<$FFFC>
We will lend our strength to you any time.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFC>
There is no clear border right now so we have to pull together to restore order.<$FFFE>
In that case I have a favor to ask of you.<$FFFC>
I want to know the true extent of your powers.<$FFFE>
Doesn't that sound interesting right?<$FFFC>
Well, that's not a problem for me, but..<$FFFE>
It'll be ok.<$FFFC>
In addition, you will be rewarded.<$FFFE>
However, make sure to prepare thoroughly.<$FFFC>
Wait a sec.<$FFFE>
What will we be up against if we accept the challenge?<$FFFE>
All creatures of Mensere hold powers beyond measure.<$FFFC>
But you've got to see for yourself.<$FFFE>
Okay.<$FFFC>
See, you needn't worry too much.<$FFFD>
Of course this battle will be extremely difficult to win.<$FFFE>
Is that so?<$FFFC>
But that is what makes it so enjoyable too.<$FFFE>
...Heh, I guess.<$FFFC>
Now, what do you think?<$FFFD>
[diehardt's name] let's see if you are ready for this ultimate challenge.<$FFFE>
...Ha.<$FFFC>
Forgive me for troubling you.<$FFFE>
...Farewell for now.<$FFFE>
I as well, will be returning to Barral shortly.<$FFFC>
My father's death has undoubtedly caused much confusion.<$FFFE>
General Dios.<$FFFC>
Let us be on our way.<$FFFE>
Eh?<$FFFC>
...Did I just hear General...?<$FFFE>
After all you just gave up the title of General because of my father's madness.<$FFFE>
If that is the case then there is no need to stay off duty any longer.<$FFFC>
I formally request you to lend your abilities to the royal family once more.<$FFFE>
Princess...<$FFFE>
The unworthy Dios will do everything in his power to be of service to youe majesty!<$FFFE>
If everything is settled, we should depart soon too.<$FFFC>
Concerning Elthlead there are matters that need to be taken care of as well.<$FFFE>
I agree.<$FFFE>
The holy rod was obtained!<$FFFE>
The dark rod was obtained!<$FFFE>
Well then, everyone!<$FFFC>
Let us return to Elthlead!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
