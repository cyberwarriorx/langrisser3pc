Enough is enough, Flaire.<$FFFC>
The battle is over.<$FFFE>
....I won't be defeated.<$FFFC>
If my blade is not enough, I'll use bare hands to keep you from invading Barral.<$FFFE>
Princess Flaire, I'm afraid you're going to be our prisoner.....<$FFFE>
I think not.<$FFFE>
Who's there!?<$FFFE>
Dark Knight....<$FFFE>
Hmmph.<$FFFC>
I didn't come here to protect the princess.....<$FFFE>
There are too many incompetent soldiers in Barral.<$FFFE>
So you're the Dark Knight!<$FFFE>
That rat......<$FFFE>
Think you're all that!?<$FFFC>
Punk!<$FFFE>
Wait, Pierre!<$FFFE>
*Huff*...wisely spoken.<$FFFC>
You'll never win against the Dark Knight.<$FFFE>
I'll let you bastards take Railym.<$FFFC>
Just return the princess to me.<$FFFE>
Flaire!<$FFFE>
Next time we meet, don't be foolish enough to show any lenience.<$FFFD>
I won't hold anything back when we fight.<$FFFE>
Flaire....<$FFFE>
I'd heard rumors, but it felt like he was under some form of coercion....<$FFFE>
Plains Southwest of the Town of Railym<$FFFF>
It can't be, [diehardt's name] and I.....,<$FFFC>
I never wanted to fight against him.....<$FFFD>
....[diehardt's name]....<$FFFE>
It can't be, [diehardt's name] and I.....,<$FFFC>
No, I never wanted to fight against [diehardt's name]......<$FFFD>
....[diehardt's name]....<$FFFE>
Barral Castle Courtyard ~ 11 Years Ago<$FFFF>
Hey waitaminute, gimme that back!<$FFFC>
That's mine!<$FFFE>
Noo, I've always wanted it!<$FFFC>
It's mine!<$FFFE>
Now, now, Flaire.<$FFFC>
Stop bugging poor [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Barral Castle Courtyard ~ 6 Years Ago<$FFFF>
Eh, what are you saying, [diehardt's name]?<$FFFE>
I'm going to be a knight.  I'm going to be apprenticed under Marquis William.<$FFFC>
That's why I won't be able to see you for a while.<$FFFE>
But why?  Don't you want to play together any longer?<$FFFE>
How do you respond?<$FFFE>
I'm sorry.<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFE>
I've had a lot of fun with you up to now.<$FFFE>
I'm sorry.<$FFFC>
But, I've always dreamed of doing this, ever since I was a child...<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFC>
For now, the only thing on my mind is becoming a knight.<$FFFE>
I've had a lot of fun with you up to now, Flaire.<$FFFC>
It would be grand if we could get together again.<$FFFE>
....[diehardt's name]....<$FFFE>
Plains Southwest of the Town of Railym<$FFFF>
How could that have been how our reunion turned out...<$FFFC>
Father, why have we gone to war.....<$FFFE>
I have to wonder.....<$FFFC>
Was it my fault that Father changed so?.....<$FFFE>
Former Royal Castle of Larcussia ~ Current Imperial Headquarters<$FFFF>
How are you feeling, Your Excellency?<$FFFE>
Don't worry about me.<$FFFD>
However, that Dark Knight must have been hurt just as badly as I was.<$FFFC>
He won't be on the battlefield for a while.<$FFFD>
And with him out of the picture, Barral has nothing that can stand against us.<$FFFC>
Even without my presence, we should be able to capture Barral.<$FFFE>
W..we've got a problem, sir!<$FFFD>
In the battle between that rogue mobile division and Princess Flaire, it looks like the Larcussian forces won.<$FFFD>
Afterwards, that Dark Knight appeared and rescued Princess Flaire....<$FFFE>
Impossible!<$FFFE>
But he had to have been deeply wounded by His Excellency!<$FFFD>
What kind of monster is he!?<$FFFD>
Does that mean that Barral also has a healer of such high caliber?<$FFFE>
Geier.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Use the fleet of airships and capture Laffel!<$FFFD>
I doubt the Dark Knight will make another appearance soon.<$FFFC>
But, be careful.<$FFFE>
.....Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
Deck on the Flagship of the Airship Fleet<$FFFF>
So the Dark Knight wasn't defeated by that young brat.<$FFFD>
I wonder just how strong a man he is.<$FFFE>
Even with the Dark Knight out of the picture, Laffel is the second largest city of Larcuss.<$FFFE>
Three days.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
No matter what kind of city it is, I'll capture it in three days.<$FFFE>
Haha, you're the greatest, Lord Geier!<$FFFE>
Hohohoho.....<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
I look forward to seeing the look of utter surprise on that young brat AltemÅEler's face!<$FFFD>
Wahahaha!<$FFFE>
Former Royal Castle of Larcussia - Currently the Imperial Headquarters<$FFFF>
Even if Geier has the use of the airship, he will be hard-pressed when fighting against the Dark Knight.....<$FFFD>
Emaillink!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Attack this mobile division of Larcuss!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
Plains Near the Northern Gate of the Lushiris Gate<$FFFF>
Finally the time has come for our first clash against the Empire!<$FFFE>
Our opponent will likely be one of the four generals, the bold general called Bortz.<$FFFE>
We can't afford to lose here!<$FFFC>
All units, attack!<$FFFE>
Listen up!<$FFFC>
For the prosperity of the Empire, we will destroy all the remnants of the Larcussian army!<$FFFC>
Let's charge with a spirited battle cry!<$FFFE>
Uoooo!!<$FFFE>
