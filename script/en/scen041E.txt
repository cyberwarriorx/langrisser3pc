-That's a secret!<$FFFE>
-Death of a PC<$FFFE>
Castle of Ordeal<$FFFF>
This has to be the designated location.<$FFFE>
I've been waiting for you, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
Welcome to the Castle of Ordeal.<$FFFD>
Here you will be given the chance to show how powerful you truly are.<$FFFE>
Wait a sec...<$FFFC>
There seem to be many familiar faces around, Generals from Barral and even Velzeria!<$FFFD>
I kinda thought they would be resting a bit more peacefully right now.<$FFFE>
This place is situated at the brink of space and time.<$FFFC>
We aren't identical to them. We exist simultaneously.<$FFFE>
And since it was the ever-so-popular Altemüller who asked us to come, we couldn't turn him down.<$FFFD>
Apart from that, we came up with a little tweak for this battle.<$FFFC>
Care to learn the details?<$FFFE>
Have the rules explained?<$FFFE>
To make this more fun for everyone, we decided to take some of your companions hostage.<$FFFE>
If you defeat me, Luna and Sophia will rejoin you.<$FFFE>
I'm guarding Dios and Flaire.<$FFFE>
Kirikaze and that obnoxious sorceress will be release once you've shown me your power.<$FFFE>
Finally, if you should be able to best me, I'll release Tiaris and Riffany.<$FFFD>
Quiet the extraordinary battle, no?<$FFFE>
In addition to that, you'll be judged unworthy if even one of your companions is incapacitated during battle.<$FFFE>
How is it?<$FFFC>
Are those minor diversifications to your liking?<$FFFE>
Oh, I'm delighted.<$FFFC>!
Let this battle begin, without further delay!<$FFFE>
An explanation won't be necessary.<$FFFC>
Let's get this battle started right away!<$FFFE>
Very well!<$FFFC>
Prove your worthiness, if you can!<$FFFE>
Let's do this!<$FFFC>
Tiaris, Riffany!<$FFFE>
OK!<$FFFC>
I'll give it my all! 220% Tia-Power!<$FFFE>
I'm curious, are those enemies really as tough as they look?<$FFFC>
Only practical field studies in destructive magic will get me results!<$FFFE>
Well then, this is our opportunity to strike back!<$FFFC>
Luna, Sophia let's go!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
Are you alright, Flaire?<$FFFE>
I'm unharmed.<$FFFC>
Thank you for releasing me. I'd be more than glad to do my part now.<$FFFD>
Well then, Dios!<$FFFC>
Let us join their struggle!<$FFFE>
With pleasure!<$FFFE>
Even the slightest mistake could be fatal.<$FFFC>
We mustn't allow ourselves to take unnecessary risks.<$FFFE>
Well said!<$FFFE>
Hmph.<$FFFC>
I'm slightly impressed, they put up a decent fight so far.<$FFFE>
Well done, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
I had hoped you would make it.<$FFFD>
However, to complete your triumph you will have to take me on personally.<$FFFE>
Of course.<$FFFC>
This is what I've been looking forward to, all along!<$FFFE>
So  you've made it this far already...<$FFFC>
But this is were your advance comes its end!<$FFFE>
You have yet to disappoint me, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
But this is the end of the line for you!<$FFFE>
You discover a switch on the throne.<$FFFE>
Do you want to push it?<$FFFE>
The throne slides to the side revealing an entrance to a hidden basement.<$FFFD>
Upon investing the basement you come across a huge doll made of metal.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Attack it<$FFFE>
Trigger the switch again<$FFFE>
Inspect the doll more closely<$FFFE>
The doll doesn't resist much.<$FFFC>
Congrats, you have defeated a piece of armor...<$FFFE>
You push the button again and the throne goes back into his original position.<$FFFD>
Somehow the switch has been jammed...<$FFFE>
While investigating the doll's chest you discover a seat.<$FFFD>
After some experimenting you realize that you can control the doll from here.<$FFFE>
Assault Suit was obtained!<$FFFE>
The carpet seems to be loose at this spot.<$FFFD>
When you lift the carpet, a simple safe comes into sight.<$FFFD>
The numbers 3,5,6,9 and 0 are available on it .<$FFFE>
Do you want to try and put in a code?<$FFFE>
First number?<$FFFE>

5<$FFFE>
6<$FFFE>
9<$FFFE>
0<$FFFE>
It seems like this was the wrong number....<$FFFE>
Taking a closer look, you notice a message written on it.<$FFFD>
It's a memo.<$FFFC>
"Don't give up, you can try as many times as you like!"<$FFFE>

Necklace of the Hegemon was obtained!<$FFFE>
I overestimated myself...<$FFFE>
Have..to...use.....chea....<$FFFE>
What a shame...<$FFFE>
Ridiculous!<$FFFE>
I won't accept anything but victory!<$FFFE>
This is tiresome...<$FFFE>
Too weak...<$FFFE>
Lushiris with you...<$FFFE>
I rushed it...<$FFFE>
Guuaarghh!<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
This Scenario is an outrage!<$FFFE>
Grrr...<$FFFC>
We'll never give up!<$FFFE>
Aahh...<$FFFC>
The blue sky....<$FFFE>
Regrettable...<$FFFE>
That was unfair...<$FFFE>
Let's see if you can withstand my blade!<$FFFE>
Excellent...<$FFFC>
Now, I see that Lushiris made a wise choice after all...<$FFFE>
Altemüller's request has been fulfilled.<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
Let us return to Elthlead.<$FFFE>
You've done well...don't stop...<$FFFE>
It was a true pleasure crossing blades with you once more...<$FFFE>
Arrghh!<$FFFC>
They didn't neglect their training...that's good...<$FFFE>
Uarrggh!<$FFFC>
I'll return...<$FFFE>
Slooow, WAY TOO SLOW!<$FFFC>
This has been taking forever!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry, Tiaris.<$FFFC>
Getting this far wasn't exactly a walk in the park, I tell you.<$FFFD>
Anyway, I'm glad to see you save too, Riffany.<$FFFE>
Thanks for liberating us.<$FFFC>
I was a bit concerned, but it also was kinda enjoyable to just watch for once.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
In that case I hope you don't mind, joining the fun from here on out.<$FFFE>
Those commoners never cease to amuse me!<$FFFC>
Such a priceless spectacle!<$FFFE>
Luna!<$FFFC>
Sophia!<$FFFC>
Are you alright?<$FFFE>
Thank you, I'm well.<$FFFC>
Once again you saved me from a perilous situation.<$FFFE>
No injuries to report.<$FFFC>
I'm ready for battle anytime!<$FFFE>
ZAPP!<$FFFE>
You have acquired great strength.<$FFFC>
Use it to protect those dear to you...<$FFFE>
Overpowered by humans again...how...peculiar...<$FFFE>
Are you two okay?<$FFFE>
This blade is as sharp as ever!<$FFFE>
I'm fine as well.<$FFFC>
After having to watch until now, I'm looking forward to participate!<$FFFE>
Kyaaahh!<$FFFC>
This is getting on my bones!<$FFFE>
Uuuh...<$FFFC>
You're still as naughty as always....<$FFFE>
You humans fight like demons...act suitably already...<$FFFE>
