Please tell me, Flaire.<$FFFC>
What really happened to King Wilder?<$FFFE>
...Not long ago, I was out in the forest hunting on my own and followed my prey deep into the forest.<$FFFE>
When I didn't come home Father and some his subordinates came looking for me.<$FFFC>
My prey had startled my father's horse and father fell from a cliff.<$FFFE>
It was a miracle that he wasn't injured seriously.<$FFFC>
But...<$FFFE>
Flaire...<$FFFE>
...Afterwards.<$FFFC>
The kind father I knew was no more.<$FFFE>
It was all my fault!<$FFFC>
Father only changed because of my mindlessness!<$FFFC>
That's the sad truth.<$FFFE>
Please everyone you must leave here, there is nothing you can do to help!!<$FFFE>
Flaire!<$FFFC>
Please calm down Flaire!<$FFFE>
I really didn't want to fight with you but I cannot bring myself to betray my own father.<$FFFE>
...I have already chosen my path...<$FFFE>
After father changed...<$FFFC>
Barral began to invade other country's.<$FFFE>
Even I have committed horrible crimes against the people of your country.<$FFFC>
There's no turning back for me any longer...<$FFFE>
What do you think you're doing, Flaire?<$FFFE>
I no longer can hope for forgiveness.<$FFFE>
...When the sun sets at this lake...remember me sometimes...<$FFFE>
Flaaaaaaireeee!<$FFFE>
Rigüler Royal Castle ~ In front of Kaiser Paul's Chamber<$FFFF>
...At long last I've got you cornered Paul, Geier!<$FFFE>
Lord Altemüller.<$FFFC>
Is it really necessary to act so forcefully?<$FFFE>
The common citizens have already suffered quiet heavily and your reputation...<$FFFE>
Are you trying to give me advice?<$FFFC>
I don't care about the common citizens.<$FFFE>
As long as Geier and Paul lay dead at my feet, I couldn't care less about such trivial matters.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
It ends right here.<$FFFE>
Even you must understand that you can't hide from me forever.<$FFFC>
Prepare yourselves!<$FFFE>
Wuuah!<$FFFE>
You have nowhere left to run to now.<$FFFE>
G,G,Geier!<$FFFC>
Cut him down!<$FFFE>
You poisoned my father and your own father before.<$FFFC>
And even Varna...<$FFFE>
Uuaarh!<$FFFE>
Eehhh!<$FFFE>
You're next Paul!<$FFFC>
The crimes you committed can only be answered by death!<$FFFE>
Guaaaaargh!<$FFFE>
Hmph.<$FFFC>
He was blown away.<$FFFE>
No matter, he can't survive a fall like this.<$FFFE>
...It is over.<$FFFE>
...And not one moment to soon, it sure feels good to be rid of them.<$FFFE>
If only there had been a way to save her.<$FFFE>
Lord Altemüller...<$FFFE>
Plains leading to Barral's royal castle<$FFFF>
What's the meaning of this?<$FFFE>
We tried to stop him but he insisted on seeing Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Shika!<$FFFC>
I'm Do Kahni!<$FFFD>
Khe Shikairo said.<$FFFC>
Shika must help you.<$FFFD>
Let me see Commander!<$FFFE>
What should we do?<$FFFE>
Don't worry, that's quiet alright.<$FFFC>
He is an old acquaintance of ours.<$FFFD>
We could use the additional manpower.<$FFFE>
Ummm...<$FFFE>
...Hm?<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
What is it?<$FFFE>
A member of the Shika tribe wants to see you.<$FFFE>
I see...<$FFFC>
Let him pass.<$FFFE>
Of course, I'll send him over right away.<$FFFE>
Oh, its you?<$FFFE>
Shika!<$FFFD>
Do Kahni is Hero!<$FFFC>
Do Kahni helps you!<$FFFC>
Better fighting evil together!<$FFFE>
It seems the chief of the Shika's herself has send him over.<$FFFE>
Thanks for coming Do Kahni.<$FFFD>
We can use the extra hand.<$FFFC>
Welcome on board.<$FFFE>
Shikaaaa!<$FFFE>
You must be tired from your journey.<$FFFC>
Please go and rest up for now.<$FFFE>
Shika!<$FFFC>
Do Kahni happy <$FFFC>
Shikaa!<$FFFE>
...Please cheer up.<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFE>
You are the leader of the Elthlead troops.<$FFFD>
If the commander feels down it has an effect on all of his troops.<$FFFC>
That's why you should try to cheer up.<$FFFE>
What do you reply<$FFFE>
I'm alright<$FFFE>
...I'm sorry<$FFFE>
Leave me alone<$FFFE>
I'm alright.<$FFFC>
I'm not feeling down as much as I look.<$FFFE>
...Is that so...<$FFFC>
If that's the case it's good...<$FFFE>
...I'm sorry.<$FFFC>
I just gave into my own sadness not minding everyone else's feelings.<$FFFE>
And I'm sorry for putting it so bluntly.<$FFFC>
But if you don't encourage us at times like this no one else will...<$FFFE>
...Thank you...<$FFFC>
For caring...<$FFFE>
...Leave me alone.<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFE>
I told you to leave!<$FFFE>
...I'll leave.<$FFFC>
But know that we all are depressed and if you don't encourage us to carry on who else will?<$FFFD>
For everyone's sake I hope that coming tomorrow you'll be back to normal.<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
