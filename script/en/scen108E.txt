Scenario ~ 34<$FFFC>
"The Shape of a Heart"<$FFFE>
As the chosen of the Demon Sword Alhazard, <$FFFC>
Altemüller ascended to be the sovereign ruler of the Demon Tribe.<$FFFC>
Sitting on the throne of the Rigüler Empire,<$FFFC>
he patiently awaits the arrival of<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name] and his companions.<$FFFE>
The upcoming battle would be the last chance<$FFFC>
to prevent Altemüller from becoming Böser irrevocable.<$FFFC>
Now, only the Holy Sword Langrisser carries onward<$FFFC>
the flame of hope, as it moves toward the Imperial Capitol.<$FFFE>
*Conditions of Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat of Altemüller<$FFFC>
*Conditions of Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Rigüler Royal Castle<$FFFF>
...Hmm?<$FFFE>
What is the matter lord Böser?<$FFFE>
Rag's life force has diminished completely.<$FFFC>
It seems that he is dead for good.<$FFFE>
After all he was all bark and no bite.<$FFFE>
Well then, Lord Böser.<$FFFC>
What will be our next step?<$FFFE>
We needn't trouble ourselves with plans for an attack.<$FFFC>
They will come here without a doubt.<$FFFE>
With Alhazard in my hands, there is nothing that could possibly threaten me.<$FFFC>
And I have you by my side too, Varna.<$FFFE>
Alte...lord Böser.<$FFFC>
My devotion to you knows no limit; I will follow you to all ends.<$FFFE>
Gladly would I give my very life, if it was for you...<$FFFE>
In front of the Rigüler Castle Walls<$FFFF>
At last, we have made it here.<$FFFE>
It was only possible with the Langrisser and everyone clinging together..<$FFFE>
It seems like an eternity since the floating castle fell.<$FFFE>
When the Empire suddenly invaded Laffel, for one moment I thought all hope was lost.<$FFFE>
Now now, Pierre.<$FFFC>
I'm just glad that everyone was alright in the end.<$FFFE>
Before I met you I thought I'd never use a blade again.<$FFFD>
I was overwhelmed by regret,<$FFFC>
doing nothing while slowly decaying from the inside; looking back I'm ashamed of myself.<$FFFD>
You however cleared away my doubts and gave me a new purpose, for that you have my sincerest gratitude.<$FFFE>
Also, when father was in danger it was thanks to everyone's help that he was saved...<$FFFE>
That's true.<$FFFE>
Gurur...Jug..Jügler...<$FFFE>
Damn right, the sole reason for thinking of others as our enemies<$FFFD>
is that we don't understand each others perspective,<$FFFC>
don't you think?<$FFFE>
Exactly.<$FFFE>
Whooah hold it there!<$FFFD>
Are you telling me that once we restore peace I can't act troublesome and violently any more, that's my profession as a thief!<$FFFE>
So you're planning to continue to be a thief afterwards?<$FFFE>
Well....<$FFFD>
Maybe Elthlead has use for someone of my trade.<$FFFC>
I wonder if there'll be need for a spy.<$FFFE>
Anyhow, this will be the decisive battle for the Demon Sword Alhazard.<$FFFD>
Whoever can claim it will have the power to shape the world.<$FFFC>
Once this task is complete I will return to my home country.<$FFFE>
Kirikaze...<$FFFE>
What soothing thought.<$FFFC>
Once this matter is concluded, I'm sure father will rejoice with us from above.<$FFFE>
Well then, shall we?<$FFFC>
Nothing less than the future of mankind depends on this next battle.<$FFFE>
True enough.<$FFFC>
...King Lewin, please give the word.<$FFFE>
Ehm...that..<$FFFC>
With Langrisser on our side we will not falter.<$FFFC>
Everyone, if we give it our all, we are bound to emerge victorious!<$FFFE>
Shiikaaa!<$FFFE>
Move out everyone!<$FFFE>
Yeahh!<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>

We just have to win this!<$FFFE>
Of course!<$FFFE>

Just...make sure to win this one.<$FFFE>
Of course!<$FFFE>

Just make extra sure we win this one!<$FFFE>
Leave it to me!<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>

Of course!<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>

Of course!<$FFFE>

We will win for sure!<$FFFE>
