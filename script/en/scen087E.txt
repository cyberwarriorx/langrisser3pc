Wouldn't you agree that lately, monsters have been attacking more frequently?<$FFFE>
Sure looks like it.<$FFFC>
Guess the Lushiris Gate isn't holding them back any longer.<$FFFE>
That's not it.<$FFFE>
Look, the power of Lady Lushiris can be felt even here.<$FFFE>
If that's right, then why isn't it stopping the monsters?<$FFFE>
Because the monsters have gotten stronger!<$FFFE>
I think the problem's with the Gate.<$FFFE>
That's just not possible!<$FFFC>
I'm sure it's the Alhazard!<$FFFE>
But, I don't think any kind of sword could have that so much power!<$FFFE>
I'd have to agree with Tiaris on that one.<$FFFC>
I'm sure the problem is with the Gate itself......<$FFFE>
Say, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
Who do you think's right?<$FFFE>
Eh!?<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Ah..er.....<$FFFE>
How do you respond?<$FFFE>
Tiaris<$FFFE>
Riffany<$FFFE>
Sophia<$FFFE>
Ask Luna<$FFFE>
Hmm.<$FFFC>
I think Tiaris is right.<$FFFC>
It's probably because the monsters have just gotten that much stronger.<$FFFE>
See?<$FFFC>
I told you so!<$FFFE>
Hmm.<$FFFC>
I think Riffany is right.<$FFFD>
For some reason, the Gate just isn't functioning at its full capacity.<$FFFC>
That's probably how the monsters have been able to invade.<$FFFE>
See, that's exactly what I said.<$FFFE>
Hmm.<$FFFC>
I think Sophia is right.<$FFFC>
It's because of the Alhazard.<$FFFD>
It certainly has more power than any of us can imagine.<$FFFE>
But, how can we counteract its power.....<$FFFE>
Good question.<$FFFC>
We'd better find a way soon.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFE>
Hmm.<$FFFC>
That's a tough one.....<$FFFD>
Luna, what do you think?<$FFFE>
...........<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
I'd say the demons have found some new way to strike back.<$FFFE>
....Guess so.<$FFFE>
...........<$FFFE>
...........<$FFFE>
...........<$FFFE>
I've got some bad news!<$FFFC>
The Imperial army's launched a surprise attack against the royal capitol!<$FFFE>
Phew.<$FFFC>
We've got not time to waste.<$FFFE>
The Imperial army's at the royal capitol!?<$FFFC>
Gah, at this kind of time....!<$FFFE>
Very well.<$FFFC>
Let's hurry and head back.<$FFFE>
Central Lushiris Gate<$FFFF>
Recently, there have been numerous monster infestations.<$FFFC>
Do you have any idea why?<$FFFE>
The Gate itself is functioning perfectly.<$FFFE>
I'm afraid that it's the influence of the Alhazard, that demon sword rumored to be held by Velzeria.<$FFFE>
The demon sword, Alhazard......<$FFFE>
The Alhazard is the symbol of the Demon Lord.<$FFFC>
It has the ability to amplify the power of an evil wielder.<$FFFE>
Then, can you explain how we can deal with the Alhazard?<$FFFD>
If we knew that, wouldn't we be able to halt the encroachments of the monsters?<$FFFE>
The only way to stop the monsters is to defeat the wielder of the sword......the Prince of Darkness, Böser, and then seal the Alhazard.<$FFFE>
We've got some trouble, Sir Kirikaze!<$FFFD>
The Imperial army has attacked the royal capitol in force.<$FFFC>
Please, return immediately!<$FFFD>
We've already sent a messenger to the mobile division.<$FFFE>
What, those Imperial flunkies!?<$FFFE>
Lady Jessica, I must hurry off.<$FFFC>
Fare well!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
