Do you have need for an explanation of the fundamental order that applies to this world?<$FFFE>
Do you wish for me to explain the basic flow of battle?<$FFFE>
Before each battle there will be a prologue. After that you will be directed to the battle preparation screen.<$FFFD>
During battle preparation you can hire soldiers, buy and sell items, equip your commanders and change their class.<$FFFD>
After you deploy all your commanders choose Begin battle to begin battle....ahem....<$FFFD>
Always pay attention to the battlefield and the deployment of enemies, while placing your commanders.<$FFFD>
Battles takes place on the map and in Battle mode.<$FFFD>
Both have been overhauled.<$FFFD>
Each scenario has its own conditions for victory, fulfilling those will progress the story.<$FFFC>
Conditions of Defeat. If those are met it's game over.<$FFFD>
The conditions for victory and defeat are displayed during the prologue before the scenario but can change throughout the course of a scenario.<$FFFD>
Those conditions also can be locked up in battle through the main menu.<$FFFE>
Do you wish for a more detailed explanation about hiring troops?<$FFFE>
Only one type of troops can be hired at a time. Note that troops are balanced and will only improve majorly along with their commander.<$FFFD>
Press L and R on the recruit-screen to cycle through your commanders.<$FFFD>
Holding L while on the map will show the amount of HP a commander and his units have left.<$FFFC>
Pressing start or Z during battle will open the main menu.<$FFFE>
Do you want to be informed about the battle system in greater detailed?<$FFFE>
This installment introduces a battle system different from the previous ones.<$FFFD>
Orders are given to commanders only.<$FFFC>
It is no longer possible to give orders to single soldiers.<$FFFD>
Also a commander doesn't carry out the orders given immediately.<$FFFD>
After pressing start and selecting "Execute Turn" all units on the map will carry out their orders simultaneously.<$FFFE>
Do you want me to explain every command?<$FFFE>
[Move] Move your units across the Battlefield.<$FFFC>
An area will be highlighted indicating the maximal distance a unit can move. It is also possible to set up a route for the unit to take.<$FFFD>
[Recover] Your commander and Soldiers will recover some HP.<$FFFC>
Recovering units cannot move or attack during that turn.<$FFFD>
[Magic] Use your MP to invoke mighty spells. Casting units can't do anything else that turn.<$FFFD>
Note that spells need time to be cast. More powerful spells take longer to cast than easy ones.<$FFFD>
[Item] Items can either be equipped or used during battle.<$FFFD>
Only one item can be used at a time and the unit becomes unable to do anything else.<$FFFD>
[Use] Use items and invoke special effect of certain items.<$FFFC>
Beware though, there are items that could break upon using.<$FFFD>
[Summon] Use your MP to call powerful allies from the realms beyond.<$FFFC>
Summoned creatures can be ordered just as your other commanders. Each character is limited to summon one creature at a time.<$FFFE>
[Skill] There are skills with permanent effect and skills that can be activated manually.<$FFFC>
In battle only skills that can be activated will show up<$FFFD>
Master the use of those commands and success will be certain.<$FFFD>
Combine commands to compensate for your allies weaknesses or to enhance their strengths can turn the tide in battle.<$FFFC>
The [Mode] and [Formation] commands will be explained separately.<$FFFD>
Until you press Start or Z and Select Execute Turn you are free to change given commands.<$FFFE>
Do you want me explain a unit's mode more accurately?<$FFFE>
There are three possible modes a unit<$FFFC>
can be set to, Defense, Normal and High Mobility.<$FFFD>
Normal is the default and most balanced mode.<$FFFC>
Choosing High Mobility as a unit's mode will increase the distance a unit can move, but will lower the attack and defense values.<$FFFD>
When choosing Defense, movement is no longer possible, but defensive power rises.<$FFFC>
Note that your soldiers have to move in order to change formation.<$FFFE>
Do you desire to know more about the unit's formations?<$FFFE>
The formation decides how unit's will place themselves in relation to their commander.<$FFFD>
A change in formation only applies after a commander moves.<$FFFD>
yš˜z The Square is the default formation placing soldiers all around the commander.<$FFFD>
ybzThe Spear can help to reach far away enemies.<$FFFD>
y\z The Wall is useful to intercept enemies coming from the back and the front.<$FFFD>
y_zy^z The Slant comes in two variations and can be handy in various situations.<$FFFD>
In battle it is of utmost importance to determine which units should make contact to the enemy. Use formations for precise maneuvers.<$FFFE>
Next, do you want me to explain battle mode?<$FFFE>
Battle mode will be triggered if two units (soldiers or commanders) have contact to another or are in proximity of ranged attack.<$FFFC>
Even if only one Soldier connects, the whole unit will partake in battle<$FFFD>
Be mindful of your unit's formation to avoid having weak units getting caught in melee.<$FFFD>
When entering battle mode two pictures will show up,<$FFFC>
one unit defends and one attacks.<$FFFC>
If you are the attacker you can choose which unit you want to attack or if you'd rather do nothing.<$FFFE>
To cycle through use the directional buttons.<$FFFC>
By default you will enter a Battle scene once two units engage in battle.<$FFFC>
You will be presented by a 3D simulation of the battle.<$FFFD>
Here you can give specific orders to your Commander and Soldier Squads.<$FFFD>
If you would prefer not to watch the Battle scene, go to the main menu choose Game Options and set Battle Scenes to off.<$FFFC>
If the battle scene is turned off, the battle results will be calculated automatically.<$FFFE>
Do you want to learn more about affinities?<$FFFE>
Affinities mean the s<$FFFD>
For example infantry units are strong against spearmen, but weak against cavalry.<$FFFC>
@<$FFFC>
Spearmen are strong against cavalry, but weak against infantry.<$FFFC>
@<$FFFC>
Cavalry is strong against infantry, but weak against spearmen.<$FFFD>
Bowmen are strong against flying units.<$FFFC>
Monks and clerics are strong against demons, gels and the Undead.<$FFFC>
There are also specialized Anti-air and Anti-ground flying units.<$FFFD>
Sailors are very powerful in water but otherwise are of the same affinity as infantry.<$FFFD>
Choosing your troops wisely is a must to do battle effectively.<$FFFE>
Do you wish to know more about the flexible class change?<$FFFE>
So you want to gain further knowledge about classes?<$FFFE>
Changing the class of a commander will result in a change of stat growth.<$FFFC>
Skills, magic and units that can be hired, depend on the class of a character.<$FFFD>
Select Class Changes at the battle preparation screen.<$FFFD>
At the levels 10, 30 and 50 a new class will become accessible, depending on the character.<$FFFD>
Note that the level count of the class is independent of the characters level.<$FFFD>
A newly acquired class will start out at level 1 while the character remains at his current level.<$FFFD>
Doing a class change mid-way won't result in any further disadvantages.<$FFFD>
Switching classes depending on the situation at hand is a key-element for claiming victory.<$FFFE>
Do you wish to learn more about how to level up a class?<$FFFE>
While upgraded classes have the same stat growth as the basic classes, unique spells and better units become available.<$FFFD>
There are two ways to rise the level of a class.<$FFFC>
You can use the divine blessing item,<$FFFC>
or gain 15 levels with the appropriate class.<$FFFD>
For example<$FFFC>
When you gain 15 levels as a Lord your class will automatically upgrade to High Lord.<$FFFE>
Do you want to learn more about the amount of experience gained?<$FFFE>
When a commander is defeated all his soldiers will vanish along with him.<$FFFD>
If you want to make short work of your enemies, aim for the commander.<$FFFC>
Defeating all soldiers first will net you the maximal amount of experience points.<$FFFE>
Do you want to learn about special inputs?<$FFFE>
Listen well for those hints could safe you a lot of time in battle.<$FFFC>
Press the Y button to move the cursor to the next commander. Pushing Y again will cycle through your commanders.<$FFFD>
Pushing the A button while a range indicator shows up, will limit the cursor's movement to the displayed range.<$FFFD>
You can speed up the cursor's speed by holding down either B or X, but X is recommended since you could accidentally cancel an action pressing B in some situations.<$FFFE>
