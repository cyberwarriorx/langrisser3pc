Former Larcussia Royal Castle ~ Before the Ramparts<$FFFF>
We've done it.<$FFFE>
But, even if we've managed to breach the outer wall, the battle from here on out will be our true trial.<$FFFE>
Looks like it.<$FFFE>
The occupying army's going all-out this time.<$FFFC>
Going to be one helluva party, if you ask me!<$FFFE>
Well, I'm worried about that aerial fortress Emaillink spoke of.<$FFFE>
Do you think they use something similar to that magically-propelled giant soldier?<$FFFE>
That's what I'm thinking.<$FFFE>
But I'd relish another chance to pound down whatever other legacy of the ancient magical civilization the Empire whips out next.<$FFFE>
Well, let's advance with due caution.<$FFFE>
Reform the troops and make sure everything is in good order.<$FFFE>
Former Larcussia Royal Castle ~ Currently Imperial Headquarters<$FFFF>
My humble apologies.<$FFFC>
I was unable to halt their progress.<$FFFE>
Don't worry about it.<$FFFC>
The fault lies with that rat, Geier.<$FFFE>
You're damned late, Geier!<$FFFE>
I am afraid so.<$FFFE>
We had come across a defect in the flotation engine for the aerial fortress.<$FFFE>
Though I desired haste, I place priority on finishing the repairs. I have returned immediately to bring back information, not only with regards to the prospects for the repairs.<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFE>
I have one additional matter to report.<$FFFD>
On my way back, I came across highwaymen attacking a supply defense brigade along the border.<$FFFD>
I was too late; by the time I got close enough, the highwaymen had fled and the defenders had been annihilated.<$FFFE>
Our supply troops?<$FFFE>
....So not only has the aerial fortress been delayed, but also our supply line has been cut.....<$FFFE>
Your Excellency.....<$FFFE>
We're already running low on supplies.<$FFFC>
At this rate, if we try to withstand a siege, we'll suffer from hunger.<$FFFD>
Do we have any other options.....?<$FFFE>
Will we have to surrender this place after all.....<$FFFE>
We are running out of options.<$FFFD>
It looks like we will lose with no supplies.<$FFFC>
There's no point in wasting our soldiers in futile fighting.<$FFFE>
If we surrender this castle with no bloodshed, we might be able to guarantee safe passage for the soldiers.....<$FFFE>
Get in touch with the Larcussian army.<$FFFC>
Let's set a conference place.<$FFFE>
Yessir, I shall arrange everything...<$FFFE>
Larcuss Royal Castle ~ Several Days Later<$FFFF>
We have no desire to make unnecessary sacrifices.<$FFFC>
Towards that end, we wish to arrange for the prompt surrender of Larcussia.<$FFFE>
In exchange, we wish to swear a ceasefire agreement, lasting until we reach our national border.<$FFFE>
I also wish to avoid unnecessary conflict.<$FFFE>
If the castle is handed over with no fighting, I think it would be excellent to accept the Field Marshal's proposal.<$FFFE>
But, I'd like to hear everyone else's opinions on the subject.<$FFFE>
I am also in agreement with this proposal.<$FFFE>
I have no objections.<$FFFE>
What do you think, [diehardt's name]?<$FFFE>
I....<$FFFE>
How do you respond?<$FFFE>
I agree.<$FFFE>
I disagree.<$FFFE>
I don't know.<$FFFE>
There's no reason to fight needlessly.<$FFFC>
I agree.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
Then, it's unanimous.<$FFFD>
So, we'll accept the Field Marshal's proposal.<$FFFE>
I disagree.<$FFFD>
Right now, our foes are in a tight spot; it's our chance to completely defeat them!<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
There is some truth to your words.<$FFFD>
....However, with the majority in agreement, I think we should accept the Field Marshal's proposal.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Will that be acceptable?<$FFFE>
....Yes.<$FFFE>
In all honesty, I'm not sure what would be best.<$FFFC>
I will accept milord's decision.<$FFFE>
It's certainly a confusing situation.<$FFFD>
In that case, since the majority are in agreement, let's accept the Field Marshal's proposal.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Will that be acceptable?<$FFFE>
....Yes.<$FFFE>
My thanks, Lord Raymond.<$FFFE>
In that case, we must go make preparations, so that we can surrender the castle in three days' time.<$FFFC>
This concludes the conference....<$FFFE>
Fare well......<$FFFE>
I wish we could have met under different circumstances, outside of the war.<$FFFE>
Me, too.<$FFFC>
Fare well, and take care when you return.<$FFFE>
Royal Capitol of Larcussia ~ Gate of Justice<$FFFF>
Riffany!<$FFFE>
Mother!<$FFFC>
Father!<$FFFD>
I'm so glad you're safe....<$FFFE>
I'm relieved to know you're unhurt too....<$FFFE>
That's wonderful, Riffany.<$FFFE>
Oh, yes.<$FFFE>
Father, Mother.....<$FFFE>
You've become quite a fine young man.....<$FFFE>
Didn't I hear that you liberated this city?<$FFFE>
No, everyone played a part.<$FFFD>
But, I don't think the fighting is over yet.<$FFFC>
I'm afraid I'll be in harm's way a little longer.<$FFFE>
I understand.<$FFFC>
It's part of being a knight.<$FFFD>
If only I were younger, I'd take up my sword and join you, too....<$FFFE>
Now, now, Dear....<$FFFE>
This is wonderful.....<$FFFC>
....Everyone, I'm so glad for you.<$FFFE>
Papa......<$FFFC>
I, I've done it.<$FFFC>
I've helped liberate Larcussia.<$FFFE>
Listen, can you hear them?<$FFFC>
Everyone's happy.<$FFFC>
Papa.....Papa.........<$FFFE>
....Tiaris.<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
Come over here.<$FFFE>
I'm still here, aren't I.<$FFFE>
You need to set the past aside.<$FFFE>
Come over here, Tiaris.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]....<$FFFE>
Father, Mother.<$FFFD>
This is the girl I was just telling you about, Tiaris.<$FFFE>
Ah.<$FFFC>
She's such a charming lass, isn't she.<$FFFE>
My, indeed.<$FFFC>
From now on, you can think of us as your parents,<$FFFC>
and talk with us about everything that concerns you.<$FFFE>
T..thank you so very much!<$FFFE>
Now, now, you don't need to use such formal speech with us.<$FFFE>
Pa..Papa......<$FFFE>
I'm still here, aren't I, Tiaris?<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]....<$FFFE>
After what happened to Lord William,<$FFFC>
I feel a bit guilty about finding happiness on my own.<$FFFD>
But, I'm still here for you, aren't I.<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>
....But, I guess I'm just not enough.<$FFFE>
....That's not it.<$FFFC>
That's not it at all!<$FFFD>
Thanks....[diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
....You need to set the past aside.<$FFFD>
Instead of dwelling on the sorrow of the past, you should live for a brighter future.<$FFFE>
.....Yeah.<$FFFD>
But, it's not that simple.....I can't just forget......<$FFFE>
Tiaris.....<$FFFE>
Larcuss's Royal Capitol, Larcussia ~ Royal Castle<$FFFF>
Even though none of the royal family remain, are you really sure you want me to take this position?<$FFFE>
What are you worried about, Viscount Raymond?<$FFFD>
You inspired our soldiers<$FFFC>
and reclaimed Larcussia.<$FFFD>
Furthermore, all of the nobles wish for you to take the throne.<$FFFC>
So, as their representative, I entreat you to accept the throne.<$FFFE>
....Very well.<$FFFD>
Though the duty you offer is a weighty one, I shall accept.<$FFFE>
In that case, what do you think changing your name?<$FFFE>
Oh, good point!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Oh New King, by what name shall we address you?<$FFFE>
Let me think.<$FFFD>
....Yes, let me be known henceforth as Sieghart.<$FFFE>
That's an excellent name.<$FFFE>
So, King Sieghart.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
What shall we call our kingdom?<$FFFE>
Hmm....<$FFFD>
How about Elthlead, that mythological name said to mean "overflowing with light"?<$FFFE>
The Kingdom of Elthlead,<$FFFC>
and King Sieghart.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
These are excellent names.<$FFFE>
Very well, King Sieghart.<$FFFC>
If you would take the throne......<$FFFE>
We have driven off the Empire once, but it is likely they shall try to come again.<$FFFE>
Barral also took advantage of that opportunity, and I am worried by the doings of the Demon Kingdom, Velzeria.<$FFFE>
I ask that everyone lend a hand a little longer, for the peace of the Kingdom of Elthlead and her people.<$FFFE>
Hurray for the Kingdom of Elthlead!<$FFFE>
Long live King Sieghart!<$FFFE>
RigEer Imperial Castle ~ Review Tribunal<$FFFF>
Since Father's condition has worsened, I have heard the reports in his stead.<$FFFE>
So....it looks like we've got a bigger problem than the delay of the aerial fortress's launch, don't we?<$FFFC>
How could this have happened, AltemEler?<$FFFE>
If the aerial fortress has just been delayed, I would not have been set back too badly.<$FFFE>
However, somehow we also ran short on supplies.<$FFFC>
My miscalculation on the supplies exacerbated the impact of the aerial fortress's delay.<$FFFE>
At that point, I decided it would be best to just surrender the castle.<$FFFC>
However, I managed to return home without the massacre of my troops.<$FFFE>
And now, Raymond has become the king in Larcuss, which is now called the Kingdom of Elthlead.<$FFFE>
.....But, whatever.<$FFFC>
Finally, the launch preparations for the aerial fortress have been completed.<$FFFE>
Now, go defeat this Elthlead and recover the castle immediately.<$FFFC>
This time they'll be the ones surrendering the castle.<$FFFE>
I'll convey your report to Father......<$FFFE>
.....As you command.<$FFFE>
Hohoho.<$FFFC>
Did you see that, that AltemEler looked so defeated!<$FFFE>
This is the greatest feeling!<$FFFC>
Huhahahahaha!<$FFFE>
Velzeria Castle<$FFFF>
I see.<$FFFC>
So the Empire withdrew its troops.<$FFFE>
In the Kingdom of Larcuss, Raymond has taken the throne and the new name, Sieghart.<$FFFE>
Furthermore, it looks like his country is now called the Kingdom of Elthlead.<$FFFE>
No matter what new name they choose, we of Velzeria shall still crush them.....<$FFFE>
Since they have currently let the Empire's troops retreat, that gives us proof that both of their armies are exhausted from the fighting.<$FFFE>
....The time is ripe.<$FFFC>
Now, we of Velzeria shall begin our invasion in earnest!<$FFFE>
Yes, Master!<$FFFE>
For an age of Darkness!<$FFFE>
For Lord Böser!<$FFFE>
Using the power of the Alhazard, we shall end this world of humans!<$FFFE>
It took Lord Raymond about a year to gather troops for the liberation of Larcuss.<$FFFE>
Now, he has retaken Laffel from the Barral army, and the royal capitol, Larcussia, from the Empire.<$FFFE>
The Kingdom of Larcuss has been renamed the Kingdom of Elthlead, and Raymond leads it under the new name, King Sieghart.<$FFFE>
However, the Empire regathers its strength and steadily makes preparations for the conquest of Elthlead.<$FFFE>
At the same time, Velzeria steps out of the shadows and openly begins preparations for a real invasion.<$FFFE>
And then, one month later........<$FFFE>
