New Kaiser Paul's Coronation Ceremony<$FFFF>
Alas, my father, Heinrich Kleist IV, struggled valiantly against his illness for a long time, but to our great sorrow, he finally succumbed.<$FFFE>
However, now that I have become the Kaiser, in my fallen father's place, I dedicate all of my power towards the defense of the Empire and the Empire's citizens!<$FFFE>
Long live the new Lord Paul!<$FFFE>
Long live the new Kaiser Paul!<$FFFE>
Furthermore, I have one additional important announcement to make.<$FFFE>
It pains me to speak of, but I fear that someone has poisoned Altemüller, who has served in the Imperial army with great merit up to the present.<$FFFE>
I think that everyone held him in great esteem.<$FFFE>
His successor as Field Marshal shall be Geier.<$FFFE>
