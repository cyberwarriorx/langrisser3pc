Tiaris...<$FFFE>
...Uhm, I'm alright.<$FFFC>
I was scared just a tiny bit...,<$FFFE>
because I always believed in you to come for me.<$FFFE>
...Everything's alright now.<$FFFC>
I won't ever leave your side again.<$FFFE>
Riffany...<$FFFE>
You came for me after all.<$FFFE>
Didn't I promise?<$FFFC>
No matter what, I will protect you, always.<$FFFE>
I never stopped believing in you.<$FFFE>
I'm sorry to have put you through such an awful experience.<$FFFE>
I don't mind anymore, as long as we stay like this, I could forget the world around us.<$FFFE>
Luna...<$FFFE>
There is no excuse.<$FFFC>
Only because of my thoughtlessness could this...<$FFFE>
Ah...<$FFFE>
Umm...<$FFFE>
Just for little while, let's stay like this.<$FFFE>
..Yes..<$FFFE>
...I'm so glad.<$FFFC>
To be able to feel your heart next to mine once again.<$FFFE>
I beg your forgiveness.<$FFFE>
Just because of me, everyone was put in such terrible danger...<$FFFE>
Ah...<$FFFE>
It's alright.<$FFFC>
Our struggles have come to an end finally.<$FFFE>
Righty!<$FFFC>
All villains were punished and the damsel in distress, Lady Sophia, was saved too!<$FFFE>
Everyone wanted to help you.<$FFFC>
Besides, it is ones obligation to help a fellow human and friend in need.<$FFFE>
Everyone...<$FFFC>
Thank you so much.<$FFFE>
I'm just glad your back to safety,<$FFFC>
right here in my arms.<$FFFE>
...Forgive me.<$FFFC>
I should have been more dependable.<$FFFE>
...What are you saying?<$FFFC>
You did come very dependently.<$FFFE>
You defeated Böser and prevented Chaos from being revived.<$FFFC>
You have reason to be proud of yourself!<$FFFE>
Weren't you scared, Flaire...?<$FFFE>
*giggle*...<$FFFE>
I believe in you, so there is nothing in the whole wide world I have to be scared of.<$FFFE>
Uuuuh!<$FFFC>
By the way you two.<$FFFC>
Just how long are you planning on holding on to each other like that?<$FFFE>
Really now.<$FFFC>
I'm already getting dizzy from all the heat you two are emitting!<$FFFE>
...Emm...<$FFFE>
Anyhow, I'm just glad that everyone is safe.<$FFFE>
...But, Varna.<$FFFC>
You...<$FFFE>
Please stop your worrying, Altemüller.<$FFFC>
My body isn't dead just yet.<$FFFE>
Besides, when Chaos was sealed the dark surges stopped instantly, so maybe there's still hope.<$FFFE>
...Varna.<$FFFE>
Emaillink.<$FFFE>
Yes, what is it, your Excellency?<$FFFE>
Will you lend me your ear?<$FFFE>
What is troubling you...?<$FFFE>
I will go on a journey with Varna.<$FFFC>
I do not intend to return to the imperial capitol.<$FFFE>
Altemüller!<$FFFE>
Perhaps somewhere in this world, there is a method that can restore Varna to a genuine human.<$FFFE>
This I have to find out.<$FFFE>
Your Excellency...<$FFFC>
However, that is...<$FFFE>
I know.<$FFFC>
Probably Varna has only a short time left.<$FFFC>
It may be an undertaking doomed to fail from the start.<$FFFE>
But I'm ready to do everything for the person I love more than mere words could express.<$FFFC>
Know that I have set my mind on this.<$FFFE>
Please take care of the stately affairs in my absence.<$FFFE>
...Understood.<$FFFE>
Your loyal subject, Emaillink, will look after the Royal Capitol until your Excellency returns; please try to visit sometime.<$FFFE>
Thank you...<$FFFE>
Well then. let us be on our way, Varna.<$FFFE>
...,<$FFFE>
....Yes!<$FFFE>
And this is how it came to be, that the revival of Chaos was prevented,<$FFFC>
King Sieghart founded the Elthlead Kingdom<$FFFC>
and the holy sword Langrisser became a legend.<$FFFE>
<$FFFC>
However, this should only be a prologue to the magnificent story<$FFFC>
which goes around the sword.<$FFFE>
<$FFFC>
And in some distant day,<$FFFC>
the wheel of fate would eventually start turning once again...<$FFFE>
