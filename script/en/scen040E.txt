Haah!<$FFFE>
Huff!<$FFFE>
Hyaah!<$FFFE>
Samson!<$FFFC>
You have to do better than that!<$FFFE>
Sorry, Big Brother!<$FFFE>
This place....<$FFFE>
NOT AGAIN!<$FFFC>
This place looks even weirder than the last two!<$FFFE>
I know we should be heading to Castle Velzeria, but...<$FFFD>
This doll flying over here, was a matter that had to be investigated as well...<$FFFE>
One thing I can say for sure is that we have put quiet some distance between ourselves and Castle Velzeria...<$FFFE>
Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't have bothered coming here.<$FFFD>
But last night I had a strange dream...<$FFFE>
A dream, you say...?<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
The doll was in that dream, waving its hands as if it wanted to invite me to follow...<$FFFC>
So I thought...<$FFFD>
I'm sorry, everyone.<$FFFE>
Little Brothers.<$FFFC>
It seems like someone has come to visit our glorious gym.<$FFFD>
What do you think?  What are their reasons for coming?<$FFFE>
I'm sure they want to expose the secrets of our unearthly beauty!<$FFFE>
Yep...<$FFFC>
That's the only possible explanation.<$FFFE>
We should release all our bodily powers to teach them a lesson.<$FFFE>
Yep.<$FFFC>
That's the way to do it.<$FFFE>
What!? Don't tell me those pompous muscleheads want to fight us, like getting physically close!?<$FFFE>
This is growing into a troublesome matter, indeed.<$FFFC>
We shouldn't exhaust ourselves in such a pointless battle. I suggest to ignore them and move on...<$FFFE>
It's decided then.<$FFFC>
We simply have to defeat them!<$FFFE>
Aaaand...he's off into his own world again.<$FFFC>
I guess it's no use talking to him at this point.<$FFFE>
Arlight, move out!<$FFFE>
Oh!?<$FFFC>
That's the Queen!<$FFFD>
Queen!<$FFFC>
Please grace us with a visit and take a seat!<$FFFE>
Are you aware how awkward this situation is for me?<$FFFE>
It's fine!<$FFFE>
Who is that Queen you're talking about?<$FFFE>
I refuse!<$FFFE>
It's fine!<$FFFE>
I'm but a humble worshipper of your greatness!<$FFFC>
Never would I dare to make fun you!<$FFFE>
Who is that Queen you're talking about?<$FFFE>
What, you don't recognize her!?<$FFFC>
She's standing right there!<$FFFE>
I refuse!<$FFFE>
This is way too suspicious.<$FFFD>
I beg of you, Queen!<$FFFC>
Please have a seat!<$FFFE>
Another great day to get those muscles pumping.<$FFFE>
Coming to the Gym everyday makes me happy!<$FFFE>
?<$FFFC>
Who are they, maybe newcomers?<$FFFE>
Big Brother!<$FFFC>
Are those weak-looking figures novices in the way of the body?<$FFFE>
Far from it! They are nothing but spies!<$FFFC>
They have come to steal the secrets of forging the ultimate body!<$FFFE>
Then they need to be disciplined!<$FFFE>
Yes, please go right ahead.<$FFFC>
However, the queen is accompanying them, so we'll have a hard time.<$FFFE>
You're right.<$FFFE>
We have failed again!<$FFFE>
Our bodies still can't endure the strain!<$FFFE>
So what have we got here!?<$FFFE>
Brrr...<$FFFC>
Somehow a cold shiver just ran down my spine....<$FFFE>
You there, Boy!<$FFFC>
You're too wimpy, start forging your body this instant!<$FFFD>
First, 500 push-ups!<$FFFC>
Second, 300 sit-ups!<$FFFD>
And lastly, undress and redress 4 times in a row!<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFC>
I'd even refuse that request if it wasn't coming from a giant, half-naked weirdo.<$FFFE>
My, what a cute little brat!<$FFFC>
We'll have to strain our muscles even more to be a good role model for him!<$FFFE>
Adon!<$FFFC>
Samson!<$FFFE>
Are the troops ready to head out?<$FFFE>
Everyone is ready.<$FFFE>
That's good.<$FFFC>
I'm counting on all of you!<$FFFE>
Big Brother, Valan.<$FFFC>
I feel kinda plain-looking today...<$FFFE>
Yep.<$FFFC>
We can't go to battle like this.<$FFFE>
Silence!<$FFFC>
What are you talking about!?<$FFFD>
We are the world's leading organisation of manly beauty.<$FFFC>
Our number one weapon is our bewitching charm!<$FFFE>
That's right!<$FFFC>
How could I forget about my pride like that!?<$FFFE>
You're just too awesome Big Brother, Valan!<$FFFE>
And remember, as long as we stay together like brothers in slips, we cannot fail!<$FFFD>
Now, let's make that sweat flow like rivers!<$FFFE>
Yuchee!<$FFFC>
Let's do this!<$FFFE>
There's always a chair reserved for the Queen.<$FFFC>
Please come over and make yourself at home!<$FFFE>
Uuuh...<$FFFC>
This is almost too intense...<$FFFE>
We get closer and closer to it!<$FFFE>
Now all our hard work will pay off!<$FFFE>
M..my face is turning all red!<$FFFE>
Uwwaaahh!<$FFFE>
All the blood keeps on rushing in my head!<$FFFE>
Beauty level is still rising...<$FFFE>
I can feel the power rise from within!<$FFFD>
Huuwaaahh!<$FFFE>
Finally, the time has come to put our ultimate secret weapon to test.<$FFFD>
Adon, Samson, get ready!<$FFFE>
Sultry!<$FFFE>
Steamy!<$FFFE>
Sexy!<$FFFE>
Finally, the time has come to put our ultimate secret weapon to test.<$FFFD>
Here I go!<$FFFC>
Arrghh!<$FFFE>
Men are not allowed to enter from here.<$FFFC>
Your intrusion will be punished...<$FFFE>
Eeh!?<$FFFE>
A noise can be heard from the inner left part of the building.<$FFFE>
Men are not allowed to enter from here.<$FFFC>
Your intrusion will be punished...<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFE>
A noise can be heard from the inner left part of the building.<$FFFE>
Women aren't allowed in here...<$FFFC>
What's this all about?<$FFFE>
...<$FFFC>
Someone, explain this.<$FFFE>
You can't compare!<$FFFC>
The queen is much more mature!<$FFFE>
As if!<$FFFC>
Tia is grown up enough to hit you badly!<$FFFE>
That's not it!<$FFFC>
The Queen outclasses any of you!<$FFFE>
Her Sex-appeal really is beyond measuring.<$FFFE>
That's not it!<$FFFC>
The Queen is the mightiest of them all!<$FFFE>
Um, if you say so...<$FFFE>
That's not it!<$FFFC>
The Queen is much more gallant!<$FFFE>
You really have a problem of fixation.<$FFFE>
Her greatness almost outshines ours!<$FFFC>
Oops I shouldn't have said that!<$FFFD>
Uh, I'm in for severe punishment now!<$FFFE>
<$FFFC>
Game Over<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
Why's it even possible to trigger a game over during such a silly scenario?<$FFFD>
That's just our luck...<$FFFE>
Ah...<$FFFC>
What's this kind of thing doing here!?<$FFFE>
Queen!<$FFFC>
It has been a long time!<$FFFE>
As far as I can remember, we are meeting for the first time.<$FFFC>
And I would highly advice you to keep a respectful distance!<$FFFE>
That's cold.<$FFFC>
Please try to remember us!<$FFFE>
I vaguely remember an incident involving people resembling you somewhat.<$FFFC>
But this was a very long time ago, no mere human could live that long.<$FFFE>
You don't have worry about the details!<$FFFC>
Fact is that you're an inspiration to all of us!<$FFFC>
I'm so happy I could cry!<$FFFD>
I promise, we will behave from now on and treat all of you as our honored guests.<$FFFE>
Well then, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
I think this concludes matters around here.<$FFFD>
We really shouldn't exploit their....hospitality. Instead, let us be on our way to Castle Velzeria.<$FFFE>
Okay.<$FFFD>
...I don't quiet get what this was all about, but oh well.<$FFFE>
Jessica can now hire sailors!<$FFFE>
Alright, everyone!<$FFFC>
It's time to move on to Castle Velzeria!<$FFFE>
You discovered an anger mark painted on the floor. In its centre the floor bears many cracks.<$FFFE>
What do you want to do?<$FFFE>
Hit it<$FFFE>
Shout at it<$FFFE>
Put your ear to the ground to listen<$FFFE>
When you hit it, a huge whole opens up in the floor.<$FFFC>
Inside you beheld a huge blue face of a weird-looking creature.<$FFFD>
Suddenly the creature begins to speak.<$FFFC>
"What's my name?"<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
Aniki<$FFFE>
Umini<$FFFE>
Ramen<$FFFE>
"Nope, those are the leaders...<$FFFC>
...I hate you..."<$FFFD>
The strange creature vanished into thin air.<$FFFE>
The creature jumped out of the whole.<$FFFC>
It opens its mouth. An object drops out, making a loud noise as it hits the ground.<$FFFD>
"Lift this."<$FFFE>
Iron Dumbbell was obtained!<$FFFE>
"Nope that's not right...<$FFFC>
...I hate you."<$FFFD>
The strange creature vanished into thin air.<$FFFE>
Nothing happened.<$FFFE>
Nothing happened.<$FFFE>
Suddenly a voice speaks to you.<$FFFE>
You have done well this far.<$FFFC>
I've got a present for you...<$FFFD>
But only if you're at least 18 years old!<$FFFE>
Do you fulfill this requirement?<$FFFE>
Great! Use it wisely!<$FFFE>
Vaseline was obtained!<$FFFE>
Most regrettable.<$FFFC>
Takes this as a substitute.<$FFFE>
Magic Herb was obtained!<$FFFE>
Open me!<$FFFC>
Is written on a hatch in the floor.<$FFFE>
Do you want to open it?<$FFFE>
You don't have the key!<$FFFC>
You couldn't open it...<$FFFE>
NO!<$FFFC>
We just finished the warm-up!<$FFFD>
Too late...<$FFFE>
Nice body.<$FFFC>
Why don't you join us?<$FFFE>
Me!?<$FFFE>
Of course you.<$FFFC>
It would be a waste not to forge your body, with all that potential you've got.<$FFFD>
I don't know.<$FFFC>
What's on your mind?<$FFFE>
I'm afraid it's impossible for me...<$FFFD>
[diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
You've gotta make a decision. So, how about it?<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
I'd love to<$FFFE>
Refuse<$FFFE>
If that's okay with you,<$FFFC>
I'd like to suggest Dios to join in my stead.<$FFFE>
I see...<$FFFC>
It will be hard and painful at first.<$FFFE>
Ohh!<$FFFC>
Being popular can be a curse...<$FFFE>
King!<$FFFE>
Get me that treacherous leader over here right away!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFD>
Hah!!<$FFFE>
Beautiful...<$FFFC>
Seems like we have lost...<$FFFD>
We have to to train harder from now on...<$FFFE>
So when we meet again, you'll definitely join us.<$FFFE>
I...I see...<$FFFC>
You refuse...<$FFFE>
Sailors....<$FFFC>
That's fine...<$FFFE>
The dream of the omnipotent muscle....<$FFFE>
Considering the circumstances this battle went well...<$FFFE>
What an exquisite rush of blood....<$FFFE>
Awww....<$FFFC>
Their just too scary...<$FFFE>
Hmmm....<$FFFE>
What a battle...<$FFFE>
Lushiris keeps me safe...<$FFFE>
When I was a kid, I wanted to be like those guys...gross...<$FFFE>
Guu...<$FFFE>
Tell me the secrets of forging the body!<$FFFE>
This didn't went as planned...<$FFFE>
Ah, the blue sky welcomes me...<$FFFE>
Queen!<$FFFC>
OH NO!<$FFFC>
That's a bit odd...<$FFFE>
OH!<$FFFC>
I'm dehydrating!<$FFFE>
Queen!<$FFFC>
More!<$FFFE>
Get up, shape up!<$FFFE>
The people of this continent are fearsome enemies...<$FFFE>
Nice, body....<$FFFE>
Extreme-Deadly Magnum-Punch of Ultimate Destruction!<$FFFE>
My heart burns as hot as the sun....for YOU...<$FFFE>
Atomic Adon's Super-Dangerous-Bomber-Headbutt!<$FFFE>
We have to go on training no matter what...<$FFFC>
It's our destiny...<$FFFE>
Look at me!<$FFFE>
Señorita!<$FFFE>
Please, no more push-ups!<$FFFE>
ANIKI!<$FFFE>
I'm too beautiful for this world...<$FFFE>
This can't beeee!<$FFFE>
To think I just joined up recently...<$FFFE>
I can't allow you to go any further!<$FFFC>
If it is opened, we'll all be doomed!<$FFFE>
Oopsy!<$FFFC>
I was startled by my own glamour a little too much...<$FFFE>
Nice punch!<$FFFE>
I'll keep forging my spiritual body in the afterlife...<$FFFE>
The end of a fulfilled life....<$FFFE>
What's your secret training method...<$FFFE>
Explosion!<$FFFE>
Whose dead!?<$FFFE>
This feels good...<$FFFE>
Je t'aime!<$FFFE>
The heads of the Gym have been defeated!<$FFFC>
Dispersion!<$FFFE>
There, that takes care of all of them.<$FFFE>
This was the most ridiculous, pointless and unnerving waste of time ever!<$FFFC>
If we stay any other minute, I swear something horrible will happen to the guy that made us come here!<$FFFE>
Alright, everyone!<$FFFC>
I think it's high time for us to be on our way to Castle Velzeria!<$FFFE>
Poor souls, they were still too inexperienced in the way of the body.<$FFFC>
But its also my fault, I've been spoiling them.<$FFFE>
....Hm this one's not human.<$FFFC>
But he still looks dazzling with that fur, no?<$FFFE>
Gurr!<$FFFE>
What the heck was that all about!?<$FFFC>
Oh well.<$FFFD>
Now that's been taken care of, let us head towards Castle Velzeria at once!<$FFFE>
