Uhahaha!<$FFFD>
I can't stop laughing in joy!<$FFFC>
Now the Empire is mine in both name and truth!<$FFFD>
Speaking of which, Geier.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Wouldn't you agree that it would be best for you to start acting as Field Marshal soon?<$FFFD>
You must quickly take down Elthlead.<$FFFE>
Before I do that, I ask for a little bit of time.<$FFFD>
There is a small matter that I would like to look into first.<$FFFE>
....Hmmm.<$FFFC>
Then, as soon as this matter is dealt with, return to headquarters.<$FFFD>
I shall muster additional troops.<$FFFC>
After all, no matter what it takes, we must crush Elthlead!<$FFFE>
As you command, Kaiser Paul.<$FFFE>
