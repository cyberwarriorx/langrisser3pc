...My body...won't move...<$FFFE>
No way....!<$FFFE>
This will never happen!<$FFFC>
Everyone will come and stop you!<$FFFE>
...Diehärte...help...<$FFFC>
me...<$FFFE>
..I, I cannot move....<$FFFE>
Such...!<$FFFE>
...Your efforts are in vain.<$FFFC>
Your dark magic against Langrisser.<$FFFE>
For this being so pointless, release me from this binding spell.<$FFFE>
...I'm gonna be alright.<$FFFC>
He promised...<$FFFE>
There's no doubt, he will come to save me.<$FFFE>
...Keh!<$FFFE>
That won't happen...!<$FFFE>
No matter what you say, I won't give up hope.<$FFFE>
You stand no chance against the might of the Elthlead Kingdom.<$FFFE>
You are using me to further your ambitions, such cowardliness will not go unpunished by them!<$FFFE>
I know, it was my faint-heartiness that allowed this to happen.<$FFFE>
But even please come for me...and..<$FFFC>
...Forgive me, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
For what purpose have I been taken to a place like this?<$FFFE>
How horrible....!<$FFFE>
Sacrificing me is a pointless endeavor.<$FFFE>
Even if Chaos is revived, the holy blade of the Elthlead royal family Langrisser will seal him back again.<$FFFE>
That I do believe with all my heart.<$FFFE>
Before long, together we will find happiness.<$FFFC>
So please be careful [diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
What is happening to me...?<$FFFE>
That can't be...!<$FFFE>
...That will never happen.<$FFFE>
Even if you call forth Chaos they will come to seal him right away.<$FFFE>
Hoho.<$FFFC>
I'm afraid you overestimate the power of your friends and your importance to them greatly.<$FFFE>
No.<$FFFC>
He will do something.<$FFFE>
Even though I'm just one person, he will come to my aid.<$FFFE>
And then he'll deal with you and Chaos!<$FFFE>
Suits me just fine!<$FFFC>
That would only mean even more sacrifices!<$FFFE>
...I have no doubt, he will come.<$FFFC>
He promised...<$FFFE>
Don't bother struggling.<$FFFC>
This is just one of my many arts as Böser the Prince of Darkness.<$FFFC>
The spell cannot be broken.<$FFFE>
Before long you will be sacrificed for the revival of Lord Chaos.<$FFFE>
Go ahead, cry and scream all you want but the flame of your life shall soon extinguish.<$FFFE>
When that time arrives Lord Chaos shall feast on your life force!<$FFFE>
The time for us demons to rise over all is close at hand!<$FFFC>
Hahahahaha!<$FFFE>
They are welcome to try!<$FFFC>
You and Elthlead and Langrisser!<$FFFE>
Once this ceremony is complete all of your petty hopes will die!<$FFFE>
