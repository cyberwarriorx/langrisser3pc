Imperial Base along the Rigüler ~ Elthlead National Border<$FFFF>
It has been some time since our main troops has set out...<$FFFD>
I wonder if Altemüller is engaging the Elthlead troops in combat already.<$FFFE>
Lord Emaillink!<$FFFC>
The enemy is here!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFE>
My?<$FFFC>
There is only a handful of enemy troops stationed here.<$FFFE>
Maybe their main force haven't arrived just yet.<$FFFE>
Don't you think it's more likely the main troops are already marching towards Larcussia?<$FFFE>
King Sieghart and Lord Kirikaze are defending the royal capitol.<$FFFC>
There is nothing for us to worry about.<$FFFE>
Additionally this gives us the fortunate opportunity to strike where the enemy is weakest.<$FFFC>
Cutting their supply lines should be an easy task...<$FFFE>
You sure the capitol can withstand them long enough for that to matter?<$FFFE>
Certainly.<$FFFE>
It's settled then, we won't return to the capitol.<$FFFE>
We can help them the most by severing the enemy's chain of supply.<$FFFC>
Everyone, let's do this!<$FFFE>
It couldn't be that Lord Altemüller have been defeated by the enemy at this time.<$FFFD>
Maybe it was risky leaving just so few men for guarding the border.<$FFFD>
With this kinds of troops a victory against Diehärte's Division seems unlikely...<$FFFD>
But if we can't hold our ground here our main forces will be cut off from supplies.<$FFFC>
If that happens we couldn't hope to implement our invasion.<$FFFE>
Now I get it!<$FFFC>
That's what they are truly after, if their plan succeeds the main force's defeat will be certain!<$FFFD>
Such a thing must be avoided no matter what.<$FFFC>
All troops, hold off the enemy with all you've got!<$FFFE>
Of course Sir, you don't have to tell us twice!<$FFFE>
Now even demons start appearing...<$FFFC>
Our luck has just turned from bad to worse, but giving up is not an option.<$FFFD>
I just wonder how we'll get out of this mess...<$FFFE>
Here they come!<$FFFC>
First division slow down the enemy's advance!<$FFFD>
Second division flank the enemy!<$FFFC>
Intercept them before they can cross the river!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
General.<$FFFC>
What are your orders?<$FFFE>
The escort for the supplies may be under the demon's attack as well...<$FFFE>
Second Division!<$FFFC>
Fall back and reinforce the escort for the supplies!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFC>
We'll be leaving promptly!<$FFFE>
General.<$FFFC>
What are your orders?<$FFFE>
The escort for the supplies may be under the demon's attack as well...<$FFFE>
Second Division!<$FFFC>
Fall back and reinforce the escort for the supplies!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFC>
We'll be leaving promptly!<$FFFE>
Protect them!<$FFFC>
Our supplies are off crucial significance!<$FFFE>
We will be covering your withdrawal!<$FFFC>
I'll see to it!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
Leave the supplies in our care!<$FFFC>
We're on our way!<$FFFE>
We are now leaving the battlefield to protect the supplies.<$FFFE>
Lord Emaillink, please take care.<$FFFE>
We have to hurry!<$FFFC>
Our supplies may be in danger!<$FFFE>
The supplies must be secured ASAP.<$FFFE>
Lord Emaillink, please take care.<$FFFE>
Well then, we're off to fulfil the assigned task!<$FFFE>
We are now leaving the battlefield to protect the supplies.<$FFFE>
Lord Emaillink, please take care.<$FFFE>
There is no time.<$FFFC>
Hurry onward!<$FFFE>
We are now leaving the battlefield to protect the supplies.<$FFFE>
Lord Emaillink, please take care.<$FFFE>
Now hurry!<$FFFE>
The supplies must be secured ASAP.<$FFFE>
Lord Emaillink, please take care.<$FFFE>
Make haste, this matter is of great importance!<$FFFE>
We are now leaving the battlefield to protect the supplies.<$FFFE>
Lord Emaillink, please take care.<$FFFE>
I just hope those supplies are still intact...<$FFFC>
In any case, we'd better hurry.<$FFFE>
The water in the pond before you glitters eerily.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Nothing<$FFFE>
Drink the Water<$FFFE>
Take some of the water with you<$FFFE>
After a while the weird glittering stops and the pond is wrapped in silence.<$FFFE>
<$f6>Stat change<$fc>INT rose +2<$FFFE>
After a while the weird glittering stops and the pond is wrapped in silence.<$FFFE>
Water of the Demon World was obtained!<$FFFE>
After a while the weird glittering stops and the pond is wrapped in silence.<$FFFE>
This was the perfect chance...<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry everyone...<$FFFE>
I'm so sorry...<$FFFE>
Don't spoil all the fun!<$FFFE>
It's hopeless...<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFE>
Lushiris...<$FFFE>
Not again...<$FFFE>
Gurgh...<$FFFC>
Beware...the Jabberwock<$FFFE>
Grrr...<$FFFE>
I could have evaded if I wanted...<$FFFE>
I shall not yield!<$FFFE>
How shameful, it seems I'll be taking my last breath shortly...<$FFFE>
Please withdraw yourself from battle, General Emaillink.<$FFFC>
You have to report this incident to the Field Marshal.<$FFFD>
We're counting on you.<$FFFE>
But...<$FFFE>
Leave those demons to us!<$FFFC>
We'll follow up as soon as they are dead.<$FFFE>
...I'm sorry.<$FFFE>
I swear by my life that we'll throw down the demons and Elthlead's troops!<$FFFC>
Now, Hurry!<$FFFE>
Keh, forgive me!<$FFFE>
If we get the chance we'll fall back to the supply unit too.<$FFFC>
Now, Hurry!<$FFFE>
Keh, forgive me!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
This is not a suitable place to die...<$FFFE>
Diehärte!<$FFFC>
This time I'll seal your fate!<$FFFC>
En Guard!<$FFFE>
You cannot be permitted to go any further!<$FFFC>
I'm afraid you have to die now!<$FFFE>
Crap!<$FFFC>
Such a nuisance!<$FFFE>
Urghh!<$FFFC>
Shutting down all systems....<$FFFE>
All my efforts were in vain...<$FFFE>
I have to keep..going...<$FFFE>
Lord Emaillink!<$FFFE>
How could you!<$FFFE>
Where's my sword...<$FFFE>
There is no death...<$FFFE>
I...<$FFFC>
I just wanted to be happy...<$FFFE>
Let's see how you handle our charge!<$FFFE>
I need more..power...<$FFFE>
I still have a duty to fulfil!<$FFFC>
Don't cross me!<$FFFE>
...Father...you were right...<$FFFE>
This isn't good...<$FFFC>
Laying down my soul to pray...<$FFFE>
Uwaaahh!<$FFFC>
This is...our land...<$FFFE>
You cannot pass!<$FFFE>
Uuuuhh!<$FFFC>
After all that happened!<$FFFE>
Don't blame me if you get hurt!<$FFFE>
I thought my magic was...perfect...<$FFFE>
If you hadn't come here you wouldn't have died!<$FFFE>
What about..our mission...<$FFFE>
I'm afraid there's no choice!<$FFFE>
This is the end...my only friend...<$FFFE>
My comrades, I'm sorry!<$FFFE>
I'll protect this border to the bitter end!<$FFFC>
Now come!<$FFFE>
GUGYAAAAH!<$FFFE>
KISYAAAHHH!<$FFFE>
GAAAAH!<$FFFE>
GAAAARRH!<$FFFE>
GRUAARRH!<$FFFE>
GRRRAAHH!<$FFFE>
GUGOORRHHHGG!<$FFFE>
GUOOHHH!<$FFFE>
GUGOOHHH!!<$FFFE>
GUUUGOOHHH!<$FFFE>
How did this...<$FFFC>
If only Velzeria didn't show up...<$FFFE>
Now only the demons remain!<$FFFE>
Good news everyone, the demons are no more!<$FFFC>
Now only the Imperials remain!<$FFFE>
Now only the demons remain!<$FFFE>
KSYAAAHH!<$FFFE>
What's that supposed to mean!?<$FFFE>
What is going on now!?<$FFFE>
Hordes of demons!?<$FFFC>
...It couldn't be..Velzeria...<$FFFE>
It's just too soon...<$FFFE>
Grruuu...<$FFFE>
How!?<$FFFE>
Isn't Lushiris gate supposed to hold them off...<$FFFE>
Maybe it's because Lushiris Gate lost it's power somehow?<$FFFE>
Absurd!<$FFFC>
The power of Lushiris Gate couldn't have diminished like this!<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F702>I dare say it's Al Hazard.<$FFFE>
It's probably Al Hazard.<$FFFE>
Al Hazard?<$FFFE>
<$F703><$F704><$F703><$F704>In any case, we have to deal with them.<$FFFC>
Afterwards we'll return to the Capitol and think about a course of action.<$FFFE>
It's over at last...<$FFFE>
You did exemplary, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFC>
You need to stay focused even if unexpected things occur...<$FFFD>
Try to learn from this...<$FFFE>
It seems like Velzeria has decided to make its move.<$FFFE>
Yeah...<$FFFE>
<$F705><$F705>We will return to the Capitol.<$FFFE>
Velzeria is a thread not only to Elthlead, but to every human in existence.<$FFFE>
First we have to help King Sieghart to drive off Altemüller, after that we'll plan our further actions.<$FFFE>
I consent, this would be the most reasonable thing to do.<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFC>
While facing the forces of darkness,<$FFFC>
there's no time to wage petty wars.<$FFFE>
In that case, let's be on our way!<$FFFE>
Certainly.<$FFFE>
That's not it.<$FFFC>
Lushiris magic is as strong as before.<$FFFE>
The legendary sword of black magic that amplifies the power of the demon kind.<$FFFE>
Most likely those demons have been send here utilizing the power of Al Hazard.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte, do you intend to pursue the Imperials?<$FFFC>
Or are we heading back to the Capitol?<$FFFE>
