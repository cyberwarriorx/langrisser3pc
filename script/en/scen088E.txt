So, now that my father's died, it's my turn to take the throne.<$FFFE>
But, Altemüller seems more popular within the court here.<$FFFE>

And when he does.....I'll call for his death.<$FFFE>
This plan might take some time before it can be hatched.<$FFFC>
But, it gives me such a rush.<$FFFC>
Hahahaha!<$FFFE>
