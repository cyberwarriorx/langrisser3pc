It seems that after all the cursed swords strength depends on his wielder.<$FFFD>
Even with Alhazard's power he couldn't compete with the our combined powers.<$FFFE>
Your Excellency, you are safe.<$FFFD>
Lately I've been nothing but trouble for you.<$FFFE>
There's no need to feel that way.<$FFFD>
One could endure indescribable agony and overcome the most grievous hardships for the sake of someone dear.<$FFFE>
Altemüller...<$FFFE>
Varna was threatened by Böser to kill me, who had taken her sister as a hostage.<$FFFE>
To deceive everyone, I drank a medicine that put me into a death like state.<$FFFC>
All that was done to give us the chance to rescue Anna.<$FFFE>
Even the slightest mistake could have been lethal, it was a risky bet.<$FFFC>
And yet you've gone through all of this...<$FFFE>
Truly, Thank you.<$FFFE>
I see, this it how it all came to be.<$FFFE>
Well then, let us initiate the ceremony to seal the demon sword.<$FFFE>
Lewin.<$FFFE>
Yes, Father.<$FFFE>
This means goodbye for us as well.<$FFFE>
Huh!?<$FFFE>
In order to seal Alhazard successfully, my soul must melt with the Langrisser completely.<$FFFD>
It is the only way.<$FFFE>
I..I see...<$FFFE>
Don't make such a sad face.<$FFFC>
From now on you are the King of Elthlead.<$FFFD>
You must hold your head high and lead our people.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
...I have faith in you.<$FFFE>
...Yes father! I shall give it my all!<$FFFE>
Awaken, sacred powers of the divine one.<$FFFC>
Saintly Sword imbued with the noble spirit of a king, <$FFFE>
take away the power from the Sword of Darkness, Alhazard, and put it into everlasting slumber.<$FFFE>
The dark aura is growing weaker...<$FFFE>
This at least should put an end to Velzeria.<$FFFE>
After all you live, Altemüller.<$FFFE>
General Geier!?<$FFFC>
What are you doing here?<$FFFE>
It is not General, call me Field Marshal!<$FFFE>
Field Marshal...You!?<$FFFC>
Never!<$FFFE>
And I had such high hopes for the poison to put an end to you.<$FFFC>
This shouldn't be possible!<$FFFE>
It was just an act.<$FFFE>
You finally dead would have been to good to be true...<$FFFC>
You're nothing but an obstacle for his majesty Paul.<$FFFE>
Too bad for you that, in the meantime I have become the new Field Marshal!<$FFFE>
So, this is what you've been after.<<$FFFE>
If I'd present your head to his majesty Paul, he'd surely be overjoyed!<$FFFE>
Fire!<$FFFE>
Watch out your Excellency!<$FFFE>
Urgh!<$FFFE>
Idiots!<$FFFC>
You missed!?<$FFFE>
Varna!<$FFFE>
Geier!<$FFFE>
Ahh, don't!<$FFFC>
The sword...<$FFFE>
As for that sword!<$FFFE>
Guwargh!！<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
Retreat for now!<$FFFE>
Hold it!<$FFFC>
Geier!<$FFFE>
*giggle*...<$FFFC>
You didn't really think you could escape,<$FFFC>
you little dumbass...<$FFFE>
Demons have appeared?<$FFFC>
What is going on...?<$FFFE>
Alhazard has recognized you as its new wielder.<$FFFC>
You are now the absolute ruler of the demon tribe.<$FFFE>
We approve of you being our new master and pledge our livelong loyalty to you.<$FFFE>
...Hmph, interesting.<$FFFC>
I accept this power!<$FFFE>
After we finally were able to help Anna, you had to die...<$FFFE>
You will not get away with this Geier!<$FFFC>
Paul!<$FFFE>
This is bad!<$FFFC>
At this rate the sword will possess him!<$FFFC>
We have to stop him!<$FFFE>
If he gets away, all our efforts so far would be in vain!<$FFFE>
Everyone chase after Altemüller!<$FFFE>
You will do no such thing.<$FFFE>
As for you, Rag!<$FFFE>
You are becoming an annoying obstacle.<$FFFE>
How can you still be alive?<$FFFE>
Me, Grove and Ferakia, we all are, in a way.<$FFFE>
Impossible!<$FFFC>
No way they could...<$FFFE>
Oh, but we are immortal.<$FFFC>
Fighting us is useless.<$FFFE>
We will see if those claims are valid!<$FFFE>
Hoho.<$FFFC>
This is nothing compared to the holy blade.<$FFFE>
Ah it seems like you can't wait to suffer at my hands.<$FFFE>
But for today we have to say our goodbyes.<$FFFC>
We have to stand by our new master's side.<$FFFE>
It isn't too late just yet.<$FFFC>
We have to chase after him.<$FFFE>
Don't tell me we have to seal Alhazard once more, what a pain!<$FFFE>
So much for the supposedly decisive battle...<$FFFE>
Emergency!<$FFFE>
What's happening, why are you being so flustered?<$FFFE>
The Barral troops have crossed the border!<$FFFC>
Please return immediately!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFE>
It seems that they have reorganized a combat force.<$FFFD>
If we decide to stop Barral, we'll probably lose Altemüller.<$FFFE>
...That may be true.<$FFFC>
However, Altemüller is just out of his mind in anger right now.<$FFFD>
After he calms down, we may be able to talk some sense into him.<$FFFD>
For now we have to stop Barral.<$FFFE>
Until Alhazard is sealed and Velzeria is brought down, I shall accompany you on your way.<$FFFE>
Plains near Velzeria Castle<$FFFF>
....<$FFFE>
....Altemüller.<$FFFC>
What are your plans from here on?<$FFFE>
It is likely that Paul sends some pursuers this way.<$FFFD>
We will be gone when they arrive and strike back at them.<$FFFD>
Furthermore we have Elthlead to be aware of.<$FFFC>
We cannot say if they will be interfering with our plans...<$FFFE>
You can leave that matter to me my lord.<$FFFC>
Alright, do as you please.<$FFFE>
Well then.<$FFFC>
In that case I entrust dealing with Elthlead to you Rag.<$FFFD>
Once I've dealt with Paul, I'll claim back the empire.<$FFFC>
We will take our leave now.<$FFFE>
Well then.<$FFFE>
Barrel castle during audience<$FFFF>
The combat force is ready at last.<$FFFC>
These are no times to sit idly by, we'll move out soon.<$FFFE>
Everything is permitted including plundering and slaughter.<$FFFC>
The attack will commence tomorrow!<$FFFE>
Our first target in Elthlead territory should be the City of Neref....<$FFFE>
This town...<$FFFC>
There was a big floodgate there, use it to our advantage...<$FFFE>
Father you can't mean!<$FFFE>
...As you wish.<$FFFE>
Please wait, Sir Dark Knight!<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
Could you truly do such a terrible thing!?<$FFFE>
...And that coming from the princess; do you care for your own family so little, opposing the King's orders like this?<$FFFE>
...Argh!<$FFFE>
