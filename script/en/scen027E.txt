I'm Lewin, Prince of the Elthlead Kingdom.<$FFFC>
I'm here on behalf of a messenger you sent to my father, King Sieghart.<$FFFE>
Go back whence you came, your attempt to usurp the throne has failed.<$FFFC>
And you'll better be grateful if I don't charge you for the full extent of your crimes.<$FFFE>
Oh my?<$FFFC>
Everyone thought he was killed during the attack of the Empire.<$FFFE>
But here he stands before us all healthily.<$FFFC>
And with an even snottier attitude than before.<$FFFE>
Right! But that's preposterous!<$FFFC>
I watched him die with my very own eyes!<$FFFE>
Then who on earth is this guy!?<$FFFE>
The Langrisser is shedding it's light!?<$FFFE>
Hmphh, it seems my cover has been blown.<$FFFE>
But no matter, it was my intention to dispose of you anyway, so we might as well apply the direct method.<$FFFE>
You!?<$FFFE>
I finally found you!<$FFFC>
Cursed Witch!<$FFFE>
Kirikaze!?<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFC>
Do we know each other?<$FFFE>
Never could I forget your visage!<$FFFC>
I hail from a country way to the east!<$FFFE>
A country that has fallen into ruin and oblivion due to your malicious doings!<$FFFE>
Ahahahaha!<$FFFC>
Now I remember, what divine nostalgia!<$FFFE>
I get it, you must be the lonesome survivor from back then.<$FFFE>
So you remember too, we've got so much in common!<$FFFC>
That means you're the man who ultimately failed to save his own lord's life.<$FFFE>
You poor thing, what an awful thing to live through.<$FFFC>
And now you're all fired up to return the favor to me, is that right?<$FFFE>
Only if I kill you with my own sword, will my chagrin clear away!<$FFFE>
Ruin, we have placed ourselves in a dangerous spot.<$FFFC>
We have to consolidate with the others as soon as possible!<$FFFE>
Yes!<$FFFE>
How rude!<$FFFC>
Leaving without even saying goodbye!<$FFFE>
Blasted!<$FFFC>
We have been surrounded.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte!<$FFFE>
No use complaining.<$FFFC>
We'll just have to fight our ways out of this!<$FFFE>
-Defeat Ferakia<$FFFE>
-Death of Diehärte<$FFFE>
Ahahahaha!<$FFFC>
What enjoyment!<$FFFD>
How about you, does shedding blood pleases you?<$FFFC>
Is the rush of battle making your heart race?<$FFFE>
Silence!<$FFFC>
I won't let my mind be clouded by anger!<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte.<$FFFD>
I fear for Sir Kirikaze's calmness.<$FFFC>
If he continues like this his life could be in danger.<$FFFD>
I suggest that you take him under your command, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Do you want to pass out orders for Kirikaze?<$FFFE>
You're right.<$FFFC>
It's probably better to coordinate our efforts.<$FFFE>
Listen, Kirikaze!<$FFFC>
Wouldn't it be beneficial if I would coordinate your movements on the battlefield as well?<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte?<$FFFC>
Very well.<$FFFD>
My only wish is to fight that person.<$FFFE>
Kirikaze has joined the division!<$FFFE>
No, he's doing fine.<$FFFC>
I don't think it's necessary just yet.<<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFE>
Lewin, that's the perfect opportunity to try out the Langrisser!<$FFFE>
Right!<$FFFC>
Father, please lend us strength.<$FFFE>
There is a pattern that looks somewhat misplaced.<$FFFE>
Do you want to inspect it more closely?<$FFFE>
A beautifully sparkling stone is situated in the center of the pattern.<$FFFE>
Do you want to take it?<$FFFE>
Secret Stone of the Hero was obtained!<$FFFE>
A crackling sound can be heard coming from the southeast...<$FFFE>
After watching the stone for a while, it suddenly shatters...<$FFFE>
There is a pattern that looks somewhat misplaced.<$FFFE>
Do you want to inspect it more closely?<$FFFE>
A stone which shines in seven colors is situated in the center of the pattern.<$FFFE>
Do you want to take it?<$FFFE>
Runestone was obtained!<$FFFE>
A crackling sound can be heard coming from the northwest...<$FFFE>
I can't lay down just yet...<$FFFE>
I don't want to...<$FFFC>
Sir..Diehärte...<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
Coty....<$FFFE>
Farewell everyone...<$FFFC>
I'm so tired...<$FFFE>
Aaah...<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte....<$FFFE>
That light...is so...warm...<$FFFE>
Sophia...<$FFFE>
GRRRRHH!!<$FFFE>
Grrr...<$FFFE>
Dammit, I failed!<$FFFE>
This could have been avoided...<$FFFE>
This is not, what's supposed to happen.<$FFFC>
But still, you leave me no choice.<$FFFE>
Aaaahh, the blue sky...<$FFFE>
I've got no regrets...<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFC>
The enemy is targeting Kirikaze...<$FFFE>
I Samurai Kirikaze of the Yamato Kingdom,<$FFFC>
head into battle!<$FFFE>
W..What's that power emitting from that sword!?<$FFFE>
...This must be the reason for Rag's demise!<$FFFC>
Anyhow, I need to report this to Lord Böser...<$FFFE>
Hold it!<$FFFC>
Our battle is yet to be decided!<$FFFE>
Tch, she got away!?<$FFFE>
...That woman!<$FFFE>
...That woman!<$FFFE>
Kirikaze.<$FFFE>
<$F704><$F705><$F706><$F704><$F705><$F706>So this is not even the first kingdom that's being attacked by Velzeria.<$FFFE>
<$F707><$f7><$8><$F707><$f7><$8>I understand.<$FFFC>
Let us cooperate closely from now on.<$FFFE>
There are no words to express my gratitude!<$FFFE>
There are no words to express my gratitude!<$FFFE>
Kirikaze joined the demon hunters!<$FFFE>
You did splendidly, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte....<$FFFC>
..................<$FFFD>
................<$FFFE>
Everyone.<$FFFE>
We have to hurry, or Velzeria might come up with new atrocities.<$FFFE>
Right!<$FFFC>
Let's take up the pursuit immediately!<$FFFE>
We should hurry.<$FFFC>
Unless we act quickly, the enemy will have the chance to regroup.<$FFFC>
Everyone, let's take up the pursuit!<$FFFE>
Come cheeky humans, show me what you're capable of!<$FFFE>
Yes, let's immerse in the bloodstained dance!<$FFFE>
GYAAAAAH!<$FFFE>
My physical body is broken...<$FFFE>
Is it due to that magic sword, that we fall before them!?<$FFFC>
Whatever it is...I'm dead...anyway<$FFFD>
Guarh!<$FFFE>
GYAAAAAH!<$FFFE>
Lord help us...<$FFFE>
May great disaster strike you!<$FFFE>
Darkness shall rule over all!<$FFFE>
I'm a goner...<$FFFE>
GOOON!<$FFFE>
GOOON!<$FFFE>
GOOON!<$FFFE>
BAWOOOOOOHH!<$FFFE>
I can't move...<$FFFE>
GYAAAAAH!<$FFFE>
My strength is fading...<$FFFE>
BAWOOOOOOHH!<$FFFE>
Curse you!<$FFFE>
FUH!<$FFFE>
Lady Ferakia....<$FFFE>
Opposing darkness is futile, you'll soon be as dead as me!<$FFFC>
Ahahahaha....<$FFFD>
Guargh!<$FFFE>
Why is...<$FFFE>
FUH!<$FFFE>
My calculations say that's impossible...<$FFFE>
Avada Kedavra....why didn't it work...<$FFFE>
Guwaah!<$FFFE>
What is the source of their power!?<$FFFC>
No mere human could have it...<$FFFE>
Uugh...<$FFFE>
Damn you!<$FFFE>
My, how worrisome!<$FFFC>
You've already killed all my little darlings!<$FFFD>
And after I put so much love into putting up this trap, shame on you!<$FFFE>
You are the last one standing.<$FFFC>
Prepare yourself for your judgement!<$FFFE>
Do you honestly think you've got what it takes to handle me?<$FFFC>
No puny human could ever defeat me.<$FFFE>
Prepare yourself, witch!<$FFFE>
So you came all the way from the east just to see me?<$FFFE>
You're quiet an untiring man, aren't you?<$FFFE>
This is hardly the time for frivolous talk.<$FFFE>
My only purpose for entering this scene of carnage is to bring you down!<$FFFE>
My!<$FFFC>
Such rampant passion!<$FFFE>
Let's see if you, although you're just a human, can live up to my expectations?<$FFFE>
Once upon a time I was attached to a kingdom far to the east.<$FFFE>
But one day an army of demons led by that woman invaded and our country was devoured by flames.<$FFFE>
Back then I wasn't able to protect my Lord...nor his wife and only son...<$FFFE>
Lord Diehärte!<$FFFC>
If you still plan on marching against Velzeria, please allow me to offer my services!<$FFFE>
My utmost desire is to bring an end to the witch that is responsible for murdering my Lord!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
