The Story of the Gel's House<$FFFC>
<$FFFE>
This is a story of no consequence for the main story.<$FFFC>
After completing this Scenario the game will be over, so beware.<$FFFD>
We, the architects of this world, have created this scenario in a hurry and only for purposes of entertainment.<$FFFD>
And maybe also to get you thinking a little bit....*wink*...<$FFFC>
If you still want to listen to the tale that's about to be told,<$FFFC>
we recommend you to get some handkerchiefs ready.....*sniff-sniff*...<$FFFD>
It has been a long way to the completion of this world...<$FFFD>
We have to rest for now....we're just too sleepy......*snore*...<$FFFE>
Olver's Residence<$FFFF>
Mom, is the rise still not done?<$FFFE>
By the way,<$FFFC>
Gels also have their own language.<$FFFD>
The following dialogues have been translated.<$FFFD>
So even though you can understand what they are saying,<$FFFC>
those who are part of the story cannot.<$FFFE>
It will only take another short while.<$FFFD>
And don't make a habit of calling me mom.<$FFFC>
It's "dear mother" to you.<$FFFC>
How many times do I have to tell you before you get it?<$FFFE>
But why?<$FFFC>
No one else has to say "dear mother".<$FFFC>
Everyone just says "mom" and one has to move with the time.<$FFFE>
Whose that "everyone" you're talking about?<$FFFE>
Everyone, like all the other people!<$FFFC>
That fat Gel especially!<$FFFE>
I should've known it was that good-for-nothing fatty.<$FFFC>
He's a bad influence, you know?<$FFFD>
Be a good boy and stay away from him, Jiro.<$FFFE>
Sure, sure.<$FFFE>
What's with the attitude!?<$FFFE>
I'll do as you wish, dear mother.<$FFFE>
Now now, don't you think you're a bit harsh?<$FFFC>
He's still a little Gel.<$FFFE>
That doesn't matter.<$FFFD>
.<$FFFC>
I don't think I'll have to remind you that this is the house of the Chief of all Gels.<$FFFC>
Maintaining order and a certain level of etiquette is a must for a family in our position.<$FFFE>
Yes...my dear...<$FFFE>
May I inquire if the meal ready yet?<$FFFE>
Oh, father-in-law.<$FFFC>
The preparations will be completed in just a minute.<$FFFD>
Please excuse me for being late.<$FFFE>
Don't worry about that.<$FFFC>
I'm sure it will be delicious as always.<$FFFC>
Truly, it is a pleasure having you in the family.<$FFFD>
Quiet unlike that impious husband of yours.<$FFFE>
Please, father-in law, don't say such a thing....<$FFFE>
Father!<$FFFE>
Hohohoho!<$FFFE>
*Sigh*...<$FFFD>
At least we have found a pleasant house to stay in...<$FFFE>
I think it belonged to a human not too long ago.<$FFFD>
What a stroke of luck for us....<$FFFE>
Gel Beauty!<$FFFC>
Dinner's almost ready!<$FFFD>
Stop playing outside<$FFFC>
and come in.<$FFFE>
Whaaat? Already!?<$FFFC>
But it's so much fun!<$FFFE>
?<$FFFC>
Gel Beauty.<$FFFC>
You should listen to your mother, she's just concerned about you.<$FFFE>
Gel Beauty!<$FFFC>
The sun is already setting and<$FFFC>
I wouldn't want you to catch a cold.<$FFFD>
Please hurry back inside!<$FFFE>
Okay!<$FFFE>
It's quiet...<$FFFE>
I presume the den of the monsters is close by...<$FFFE>
Maybe they have invaded that house over there, let me take a peek.<$FFFE>
Be careful.<$FFFE>
Sure will.<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFC>
I can't get that door open, it doesn't even flinch.<$FFFD>
I wonder if there's a specific way to get in.<$FFFE>
This seems awfully familiar...<$FFFC>
Anyway, you'll have to use magic to open it up.<$FFFE>
Oh, right.<$FFFC>
Give me one minute!<$FFFE>
Hey now!<$FFFC>
That's not really a good idea.<$FFFC>
You'd better let someone like me handle this with discretion...<$FFFE>
Here I go!<$FFFD>
<$fe><$3c>Meteeeeeeoooorrr!<$FFFE>
...Don't say I didn't warn you...<$FFFE>
Kyaahh!<$FFFE>
Gel Beauty!<$FFFE>
Take this!<$FFFE>
And this!<$FFFE>
This'll finish you!<$FFFE>
OK!<$FFFC>
The door's open!<$FFFE>
......<$FFFE>
What was that noise just now!?<$FFFE>
Gel Beauty come back inside!<$FFFC>
Hurry!<$FFFE>
Alright, let's move on to the next door!<$FFFE>
I..it's a human!<$FFFE>
A human!?<$FFFD>
Gel Beauty, you have to hurry!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
It's a Gel!<$FFFE>
We'll be right there!<$FFFE>
Don't worry, I can handle this myself.<$FFFD>
I've got plenty mana left to deal with this one!<$FFFE>
Noo!<$FFFC>
Don't come closer!<$FFFE>
Not a chance!<$FFFC>
You've got nowhere to run!<$FFFC>
Meteor!<$FFFE>
Kyaaahhh!<$FFFC>
Moooomyyyy!!<$FFFE>
Good, that takes care of that!<$FFFE>
Gel Beauty!<$FFFE>
You filthy humans!<$FFFC>
Father, Jiro you have to get away from here!<$FFFD>
We'll stay back and buy some time for you to escape!<$FFFE>
Nonsense!<$FFFC>
I wouldn't wanna leave such an important task to a slacker like yourself.<$FFFC>
I'll stay here and you two make sure that Jiro gets to safety!<$FFFE>
No, please don't worry about us.<$FFFD>
We'll catch up to you in no time, so please go!<$FFFE>
...Fine.<$FFFE>
This door's next.<$FFFD>
Meteor!<$FFFE>
One more!<$FFFE>
And the grand finale!<$FFFE>
What? Don't mess with Tia!<$FFFE>
They're here!<$FFFD>
Father, please take care of Jiro!<$FFFE>
Of course.<$FFFC>
We can't afford to lose!<$FFFE>
Umm....<$FFFE>
There's a nest of Gels inside that house.<$FFFD>
They were all over the place with their wobbly bodies!<$FFFC>
Oh, it was disgusting!<$FFFE>
Good work, scouting!<$FFFC>
Let's get them in one go!<$FFFE>
Gel Taro!<$FFFC>
Something strange seems to be going on around here!<$FFFE>
Humans!<$FFFC>
The humans are attacking!<$FFFD>
Gel Child!<$FFFC>
You have to wait here!<$FFFD>
I will go and see if I can help father!<$FFFE>
O..okay.<$FFFC>
Gel Taro, please be careful.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
Gel reinforcements have arrived!<$FFFE>
They shouldn't pose any real threat.<$FFFD>
Everyone!<$FFFC>
Make sure to get all of them!<$FFFE>
Forgive me...Everyone...<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
My power ways insufficient....<$FFFE>
I wish I could've done more...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry...<$FFFE>
My?<$FFFE>
My apologies....<$FFFE>
Failure!<$FFFC>
Forgive me, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
Uuu...<$FFFC>
...Run...everyone...<$FFFE>
Darling!<$FFFE>
Honey...<$FFFC>
You have been my one and only...<$FFFC>
You must live....<$FFFE>
Daaaarrliiiiiing!<$FFFE>
Father!<$FFFE>
Daadyyyy!<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
Cough...cough...<$FFFE>
Honey!<$FFFC>
Hold on!<$FFFE>
Look...after...the children...<$FFFC>
...Please...<$FFFE>
Honeeyyyy!!<$FFFE>
Oh, my dear wife...<$FFFC>
At last we shall be reunited...<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFC>
You were right...I'm still too immature...<$FFFD>
Please forgive my lack of filial piety....<$FFFE>
...It hurts...<$FFFC>
...so much....<$FFFE>
Dear father...<$FFFD>
Dear mother...<$FFFE>
It hurts...stop this...madness..<$FFFE>
Uurrgggh!<$FFFE>
Jiro....<$FFFC>
...and Father too....<$FFFD>
Honey!<$FFFE>
his ended sooner than I thought.<$FFFD>
This battle was easy as pie.<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFD>
And since we exterminated all the heinous monsters,<$FFFC>
the people of this land can live in piece.<$FFFD>
Alright everyone, let us return to our original task!<$FFFE>
And thus,<$FFFC>
the Gel's House and with it all the hopes and dreams of its residents perished.<$fe><$f>.<$fe><$f>.<$fe><$f>.<$FFFE>
Utilizing the power of love, the Gel wife fuses with the Gel husband, multiplying his power by doing so!<$FFFE>
Utilizing the power of love, the Gel husband fuses with the Gel wife, multiplying his power by doing so!<$FFFE>
Ghastly Humans!<$FFFC>
Prepare to pay for what you've done!<$FFFE>
Dreadful Humans!<$FFFC>
You shall feel my sorrow!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
